This document specifies an HTTP API for placing bookings to participate in
physical activities, either by attending events or through the use of leisure
or sports facilities.

    <section id='sotd'>
Contributions to this document are not only welcomed but are actively solicited
and should be made via
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api/issues) and
pull requests. The source code is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api).

    <div class="note">
This document represents a complete Editors Draft. It is currently in the final stages of community review and we hope that it is nearing stability. The draft is intended to allow developers to provide feedback by developing proof-of-concept implementations. We encourage developers to explore this API and
contribute to the development of the specification.
    </div>

    </section>

    <section class="informative">
# Introduction

The document is an output of the
[OpenActive Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/). As part
of the [OpenActive](https://openactive.io) initiative, the community group is
developing standards that will promote the publication and use of open
[opportunity data](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#categories-of-physical-activity-data)
in helping people to become more physically active.

The Community Group have already published specifications that define standard
data models ([[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]) and support the publication and
harvesting of data in standard formats ([[RPDE]]).

This existing work helps increase the discovery of opportunities for people to
be active. This specification builds on that work by defining an HTTP API that
can be implemented by <a>Booking Systems</a> that are publishing opportunity data. By
allowing third-party applications to place bookings in their systems, it becomes
 possible for more people to participate in events or make use of leisure and
 sporting facilities.

The specification defines the flow of HTTP requests and responses between the
booking system (server) and the third-party application (client). This includes
definitions of the overall application flow, detailed request and response
formats and the potential error conditions that applications may encounter.

## Scope and requirements

The current scope of the specification should conform to a set of
[use cases and requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsCr071V12i_2g0DK818OAGlEAJFLWwkBp9bpgx4fo8/edit?usp=sharing)
that have previously been identified and discussed with the OpenActive
community.

The focus of the initial versions of this specification will be on the simplest
use cases that will support making bookings on behalf of users. This core
functionality includes:

* __Pricing and availability__ – checking the price and current availabilty of
an event or for the use of a facility
* __Leasing__ – temporarily reserving spaces for a user to attend an event or
make use of a facility, whilst placing a booking
* __Booking__ – placing and viewing bookings, and where necessary, confirming
receipt of payment from users
* __Multiple order items__ - handling bookings for multiple events ("shopping carts") and for groups of users
* __Child booking__ - booking on behalf of a child

A number of additional requirements that relate to the booking of events and
facilities are currently out of scope:

* creating and managing accounts for users
* more complex pricing options, e.g. membership based pricing
* waiting lists for events

It is possible that future versions of this specification may include support
for these or other features. Revisions will be driven by the needs of the
community.

### Functionality that is out of scope

By design this specification will not define some types of functionality.

These have been declared as permanently out of scope because they are either
adequately covered by existing specifications, or will be covered by future
work of the OpenActive Community Group.

The functionality that is currently defined as out of scope includes:

* __API authentication and security__ – while the specification recommends some
best practices relating to authentication and security it does not mandate a
specific means of securing an API. Implementers are free to choose the system
that offers the best security for their platform and users
* __Payment processing__ – the design assumes that all payment handling will
be carried out by the third-party application, in a separate payment flow.
Booking systems and application developers are able to use the payment and
reconciliation mechanisms that provide the best options for their customers
* __API business models__ – the design is agnostic to any business models that
might govern the use of the API, e.g. revenue-sharing or transaction processing
fees
* __Discovery__  – finding, filtering and searching for opportunity data. This
specification assumes that the client and server applications have already
shared data about the relevant opportunities. Additional functionality in this
area will be addressed by future specifications from the Community Group

## Audience

The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

* Software developers who want to implement the API, e.g. as part of a booking
system
* Software developers building client libraries or applications that will use
the API

The following sections introduce terminology, concepts and requirements that
underpin the design of the API. This content might also be useful for a wider
audience, e.g. business analysts or product managers looking for a high-level
overview of the API functionality.

# Key Actors

Of all the organisations and systems involved in a transaction, the API defined
by this specification is scoped tightly to only specify interactions between the <a>Broker</a> and
<a>Booking System</a>, with high level prompts for interactions with a <a>Payment Provider</a>.

# Booking Flow

## User Journey
The booking journey of a <a>Customer</a> is generalised into the following key steps:

1. **Select**: Customer selects an item
2. **Register / Login**: Customer enters personal details
3. **Book and Pay**: Customer enters payment details

Note that some or all steps may not actually be visible to the user if details are already known (e.g. known registration or payment details, or booking via voice command).

<figure>
 <img src="userjourney.png" alt="High level user journey">
 <figcaption>Illustration of the expected user journey.</figcaption>
</figure>


## High-level summary of the API

This specification assumes that the <a>Broker</a> has already obtained opportunity data from the <a>Booking System</a> that includes descriptions of `SessionSeries`, `FacilityUse`, `Slot` etc. The <a>Broker</a> MUST present an up-to-date view of availability data (for example by frequently harvesting data via an opportunity data [[RPDE]] open feed) for the <a>Customer</a> to select items to book, as this data may change over time. The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` and `remainingUses` properties in the opportunity data are up-to-date, and only include places already booked and *not* places currently reserved by leases.

- The <a>Broker</a> generates session [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) which it uses throughout the process.

- After both "**1. Select**" and "**2. Register / Login**", the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to confirm the price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, and retrieve a total order price. These calls are illustrated as checkpoints **C1** and **C2** on the diagram below.

- After "**3. Book and Pay**", the <a>Broker</a> first _authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if required by the payment provider), then confirms the booking with <a>Booking System</a> using an `Order` (**B** on the diagram below), and finally _captures_ the payment.

- The <a>Booking System</a> adds an `Order` to an <a>Orders feed</a> specific to the <a>Broker</a>, which the <a>Broker</a> reads to update its internal state, generate Invoices, and deliver a notification to the Customer.

<figure>
 <img src="bookingflow.png" alt="High level booking flow">
 <figcaption>Illustration of high level booking flow.</figcaption>
</figure>


### Broker contract with Booking System

To complete a successful booking journey:

- The <a>Broker</a> SHOULD call **C1** (without customer details)
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call **C2** (with customer details), to retrieve the total order, with the exception of free orders where the order total is not required.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call **B** (with payment details), and store the resulting `Order`.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST process all updates to the `Order` from the <a>Orders feed</a>

If **B** fails, the <a>Broker</a> MUST cancel the payment without any consequence to the <a>Customer</a> or <a>Seller</a>.

### Booking System contract with the Broker

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to **C1** (without customer details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an indicative total order price, or a relevant error.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to **C2** (with customer details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an exact total order price, or a relevant error.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to **B** with a completed `Order`, or a relevant error. The whole booking succeeds or fails as one.
- Upon any cancellations or updates to the `Order` or any `OrderItem` within it, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the updated `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

With the exception of leasing, **C1** and **C2** MUST NOT have any side effects.

### Leasing

In order to ensure that items cannot be "stolen" from a <a>Customer</a>'s shopping basket by another <a>Customer</a>, the use of time-bound leases are RECOMMENDED, however they are not required to ensure a low barrier of entry for implementers of the specification.

Individually at **C1** and **C2**, the <a>Booking System</a> can opt to create (or extend) a lease for the <a>Broker</a>. Whether they opt to do so may depend on the <a>Booking System</a>'s capability to support leases, or on the <a>Seller</a>'s configuration of the <a>Booking System</a>. At **C1** the lease is anonymous, at **C2** customer details are provided.

If a lease is created at **C1** and/or **C2** it is used during **B**, if not or if it had expired the booking completes anyway provided sufficient inventory is available.

The specification is designed to allow for leasing to be implemented at a later stage by a <a>Booking System</a> without affecting the <a>Broker</a>'s implementation.

When a lease is created, a `Lease` object MUST be returned in the `OrderQuote`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of lease">
  "lease": {
    "type": "Lease",
    "leaseExpires": "2018-10-01T11:00:00Z"
  }
</pre>

The `leaseExpires` MAY be used to inform the `Customer` of the time they have remaining.

</figure>

i) "**1. Select**" - User browses broker site anonymously and adds something to basket

  - <a>Broker</a> MUST have determined at least one an Open Booking <a>bookable</a> opportunity each with an associated <a>Applicable `offer`</a> from the user's browsing, using the most up-to-date opportunity data.
  - <a>Broker</a> generates session UUID.
  - If any catastrophic failure occurs during the booking flow, the UUID MUST be regenerated to allow for a clean retry of the booking. UUID SHOULD NOT be regenerated for expected errors.

ii) **C1** - <a>Broker</a> call with `OrderQuote` including UUID without a `customer` object to check availability and that the combination of items requested can be purchased (call is idempotent), <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `OrderQuote`.

  - <a>Booking System</a> creates anonymous lease for that UUID if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and `totalPaymentDue` confirmation. An `OrderQuote` response with HTTP Status 200 will be returned if the all requested items are available. The `OrderQuote` may include a `lease` to indicate a lease has also been created against the UUID.
  - `OrderQuote` includes `totalPaymentDue`, which allows the <a>Broker</a> to update any UI with the total, as well as enumerated `OrderItem`s with their respective details that can be rendered by the <a>Broker</a> to ensure accuracy (rather than relying on syncing with the open feed).
  - The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that the data returned to the <a>Broker</a> in the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` and `remainingUses` properties are up-to-date, and only include places already booked and *not* places currently reserved by leases from competing `OrderQuote`s.

iii) "**2. Register / Login**" - User clicks checkout and enters personal details

  - The <a>Customer</a> MUST have indicated that their personal information is being submitted to the <a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Seller</a>.

iv) **C2** - <a>Broker</a> call with `OrderQuote` including UUID with a `customer` object to check viability (call is idempotent), <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `OrderQuote`.

  - <a>Booking System</a> creates named lease for that UUID if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and `totalPaymentDue` confirmation. Works exactly as **C1**.
  - <a>Broker</a> presents the contents of the `OrderQuote` to the `Customer` to ensure they have the most up-to-date price and availability before proceeding with the purchase.

v) "**3. Book and Pay**" - User enters payment details and clicks Book

  - The <a>Customer</a> MUST have been made aware of and assent to any relevant `termsOfService`.
  - The <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if no `OrderItem`s in the `OrderQuote` contain any `error`s.

vi) **Authorise Payment** - <a>Broker</a> pre-authorises `totalPaymentDue` from <a>Payment Provider</a>

  - `Order` `id` (which includes the UUID) SHOULD be used as a reference in the <a>Payment Provider</a>, if possible.

  - The <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `Order` request with an internal status of `https://openactive/PaymentAuthorized` at this point.

vii) **B** - <a>Broker</a> call with `Order` including UUID with a Person object to check viability, with a Payment object, and `totalPaymentDue` including the total amount pre-authed (call is idempotent, can be retried if 500 returned), <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `Order`.

  - The `identifier` of the `Payment` is taken from the payment pre-authorization.

  - If the `totalPaymentDue` included in the `Order` object is different to the current `totalPaymentDue` (which might have changed since **C2**, e.g. if the headline price is changed in the booking system between these two steps), the booking fails but the lease is sustained so that the user can be prompted whether they want to continue with the new amount.

  - If some of the leases have expired, or if leases are not supported, then the booking system attempts to make the booking anyway. If there are no spaces available the booking fails.

  - If the booking succeeds only for some basket items, the whole transaction is rolled back and the entire booking fails.

  - If there's a network failure, e.g. no response from server, then <a>Broker</a> can resubmit with same UUID. As the call is idempotent, the Booking System will need to track the UUID supplied by <a>Broker</a> against any successful orders, to ensure that it can return the same `Order` for subsiquent requests. <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT reuse UUIDs across multiple `Order`s.

  - The booking is considered as complete and paid by the <a>Booking System</a> at this point.

  - The `Order` returned from this call MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a>, to be subsequently updated by the <a>Orders feed</a>.

  - If the <a>Broker</a> requires any `Order` properties included in the request but OPTIONAL in the `Order` response, including the `customer`, it must store them alongside the `Order` as part of this call, as they may not be included in the `Order` response or the <a>Orders feed</a>.

  - The <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `Order` response in with an internal status of `https://schema.org/OrderPaymentDue` at this point (or `https://openactive/PaymentCaptured` if no payment is due).

viii) **Capture Payment** - <a>Broker</a> captures `totalPaymentDue` from payment provider

  - If an error occurs during capture (very unlikely but possible due to system failure, and detectable using the internal status, and this may only be noticed after the event due to server failure and observation of logs, the <a>Broker</a> MUST either:
    - Initiate manual capture via e.g. the Stripe console. Note the pre-auth will typically last for 7 days, so manual capture is still possible after the event.
    - Capture the payment from the user manually.
    - Absorb the loss and make a new payment for the same amount with the same UUID in the payment provider (better for UX / customer service, if manual capture not possible).
    - Perform the rollback procedure detailed in the following section.
  - To ensure payment capture errors are detected and resolved the <a>Broker</a> MUST periodically check for any `Orders` that have not been updated in over a 5 minutes, and are in a state other than `https://schema.org/OrderDelivered`.

 - It is the <a>Broker</a>'s responsibility to ensure that payment has been captured.

 - The <a>Broker</a> MUST update the `Order` in with an internal status of `https://openactive/PaymentCaptured` after payment is successfully captured.

ix) **Invoice Generation** and **Customer Notification** - Upon successfully capturing payment, the <a>Broker</a> generates invoices, sends <a>Customer</a> notifications, and stores the `Order` in a success state based on the response from **B**.

 - The <a>Broker</a> MUST update the `Order` in with an internal status of `https://schema.org/OrderDelivered` after invoices have been created and notifications successfully sent.

x) **Refunds an Cancellation** - The <a>Broker</a> subscribes to updates from the <a>Booking System</a> to process cancellations and refunds.
  - A secure <a>Orders feed</a> of `Order`s MUST be provided by the <a>Booking System</a>, with the contents of the feed specific to the authentication credentials. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of <a>Booking Systems</a>, even when changes are made outside of the <a>Broker</a>. This also allows the <a>Broker</a> to handle refunds to cancellations, and process notifications to <a>Customers</a> in a consistent way.
  - The <a>Booking System</a> must ensure that the `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system, for the properties included in the feed.
  - The <a>Broker</a> uses these `Order`s to process refunds and send update notifications to the <a>Customer</a>.

### Single state Orders

The `Order` is created in a successful state, although their `OrderItem`s may be cancelled by either the <a>Customer</a> or the <a>Seller</a>, the `Order` itself within the <a>Booking System</a> will not exist in the any other state. The `orderStatus` property of the `Order` MUST NOT be used and is reserved for future evolution of the specification.


### Payment Capture Rollback

The following actions MUST be performed to rollback the `Order` following an error during Capture Payment, starting at the internal status of the `Order` and continuing through the list from that point unless otherwise specified:

1. https://openactive/PaymentCaptured - Invoice generation and notification should simply be retried, with no further rollback steps taken - a rollback SHOULD NOT be performed from this status.
2. https://schema.org/OrderPaymentDue - Issue a DELETE request for the `Order` to remove it from the <a>Booking System</a>.
3. https://openactive/PaymentAuthorized - Cancel the associated Payment Authorisation from the <a>Payment Provider</a>.
4. Soft delete the contents of the `Order` from the <a>Broker</a> (including any personal data), retaining the UUID.

Note that due to the ordering of the Booking Flow, no notifications will have been sent to the <a>Customer</a> and no money taken, so no notifications regarding the rollback are required assuming it is performed promptly.


### Order Feed Inconsistencies

An error condition exists where an unrecognised `Order` item is found by the <a>Broker</a> on the feed. Due to internal status of `Order`s being monitored as described previously, there should always be a matching `Order` to any UUID on the <a>Orders feed</a> even if it has been soft-deleted. This would make an unrecognised `Order` an impossible scenario, and hence an unrecognised `Order` should be logged as a serious error within the <a>Broker</a> and promptly investigated.

# Broker Roles

A <a>Broker</a> is an actor that arranges transactions between a <a>Seller</a> and <a>Customer</a>, either directly or indirectly.

From a contractual and taxation perspective, there are two types of Broker, and agent (`AgentBroker`), and a reseller (`ResellerBroker`), as well direct purchase (`NoBroker`).

Note that this specification does not deal with contractual relationships, and simply provides a mechanism to record bookings.

## `ResellerBroker`

### Definition
A reseller is a company or individual that purchases goods or services with the intention of selling them rather than consuming or using them. This is usually done for profit (but could be resold at a loss).

### Contractual Relationships
In the context of OpenActive, a `ResellerBroker` contracts directly with the <a>Seller</a> as a business-to-business relationship to purchase access to the opportunity. It then, at a later point in time (which may only be milliseconds later), separately forms a contractual relationship with the <a>Customer</a>, who purchases access to the opportunity from the `ResellerBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="ResellerBroker.png" alt="ResellerBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in ResellerBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>


### Taxation
The `ResellerBroker`'s purchase from the <a>Seller</a> is business-to-business, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the <a>Customer</a>.
The <a>Customer</a>'s purchase from the `ResellerBroker` is business-to-consumer, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the <a>Seller</a>.

Hence any tax exception that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. if the <a>Seller</a> is an [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is not relevant here, as no direct contractual relationship is formed between <a>Seller</a> and <a>Customer</a>.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and <a>Seller</a>. It does include provision for the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and <a>Customer</a> explicitly, though it may be repurposed by the broker to perform this function by treating the Broker as a Booking system. This specification also does not include provision for the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship with any payment provider (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.
When the brokerRole is set to `ResellerBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the "broker" specified in the Order.
Note that the `customer` may still optionally be included in the Order, for example to help front-of-house staff identify the <a>Customer</a>.

### Conformance criteria
When the <a>Broker</a> generates the <a>Invoice</a>, it must be made payable to `Order.broker`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` is optional.


## `AgentBroker`

### Definition
An agent is authorized to act on behalf of another (the <a>Seller</a>, or "principle") to create legal relations with a third party (the <a>Customer</a>). Succinctly, it may be referred to as the equal relationship between a <a>Seller</a> and an agent whereby the principal, expressly or implicitly, authorizes the agent to work under his or her control and on his or her behalf. The agent is required to negotiate on behalf of the principal (<a>Seller</a>) and/or bring them and third parties (<a>Customers</a>) into contractual relationship.

### Contractual Relationships
There are three separate types of contractual relationship involved:
`AgentBroker` with <a>Seller</a>, known as the principal-agent relationship or "internal" relationship;
`AgentBroker` with <a>Customer</a> with whom they deal on their <a>Seller</a>'s behalf ("external relationship"); and
<a>Seller</a> with <a>Customer</a> when arranged by an `AgentBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="AgentBroker.png" alt="AgentBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in AgentBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
While facilitated by the `AgentBroker`, the primary purchase is made by the <a>Customer</a> directly from the <a>Seller</a>, as would be the case if the <a>Customer</a> was to purchase from the <a>Seller</a> independently.
Hence any tax exception that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. if the <a>Seller</a> is an [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is relevant here.

The <a>Customer</a>'s relationship with `AgentBroker` is business-to-consumer. Hence any additional services (e.g. customer-facing booking fees) are subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `AgentBroker` as the `seller`.

The `AgentBroker`'s relationship with the <a>Seller</a> is business-to-business. Hence any additional services (e.g. booking commission) are subject to the appropriate taxation.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a>.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship between the `AgentBroker` and the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. for booking commission), between the `AgentBroker` and the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. for booking fees) or with any payment provider (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships and the reconciliation of associated invoices MUST be handled separately.
When the brokerRole is set to "AgentBroker", this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the Order.

### Conformance criteria
When the <a>Broker</a> generates the <a>Invoice</a>, it must be made payable to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

### Informed purchase
When using a `brokerRole` of `AgentBroker`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST make the customer aware that they are purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> via the <a>Broker</a>, and not directly from the <a>Broker</a>.

## `NoBroker`

### Definition
This specification supports direct purchase by a <a>Customer</a> (for example in the context of the <a>Seller</a>'s own website, or for businesses that purchase large volumes of FacilityUse slots to run leagues).

### Contractual Relationships
The contractual relationship is a simple one between the <a>Seller</a> and the <a>Customer</a>.

<figure>
 <img src="NoBroker.png" alt="NoBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in NoBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
The purchase is made by the <a>Customer</a> directly from the <a>Seller</a>, as would be the case if the <a>Customer</a> was to purchase from the <a>Seller</a> outside of this specification.
Hence any tax exception that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. if the <a>Seller</a> is an VAT exempt eligible body) is relevant here.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a>.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship with any payment provider (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.

When the brokerRole is set to "NoBroker", this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the Order.

### Conformance criteria
When an <a>Invoice</a> is generated, it must be made payable to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST NOT be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

# Systems of Record


## Roles and responsibilities overview


For the purposes of this specification, the key components of a booking are: `Order`, <a>Invoice</a>, <a>Payment</a> and <a>Refund</a>.

Note that `OrderQuote` is a subclass of `Order` used during the `Order` creation process, and is not explicitly persisted.

The <a>Broker</a> has visibility of all components, while for simplicity of implementation the <a>Booking System</a> only has visibility of the `Order`, as shown below:

<figure>
 <img src="roles.png" alt="Roles and responsibilities">
 <figcaption>Roles and responsibilities</figcaption>
</figure>

`Order`s are the basis of the exchange between the <a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Broker</a>, with `OrderQuote`s used as part of the `Order` creation process. This specification describes a detailed model and API to allow <a>Brokers</a> to manipulate `Order`s, and only high level functional requirements for the expected behaviour of <a>Invoices</a>, <a>Payments</a>, and <a>Refunds</a>.


| Component | Description | Owner | Audit |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| <dfn>`Order`</dfn> | A mutable object that encompasses the live state of the bookable `Event`s within the booking system. An `Order` has a `orderItem`s, a `totalPaymentDue`, and all tax details, but is not itself a legal representation of a purchase from the <a>Seller</a>. | <a>Booking System</a>. | Mutable |
| <dfn>Invoice</dfn> | An immutable object that is a legal representation of the purchase, which MUST be rendered to the <a>Customer</a> as a legally permissible tax receipt, and exist as a tax point. A new <a>Invoice</a> MUST be generated for the `Order` to replace the previous <a>Invoice</a> each occasion that an `orderItem` within an `Order` is cancelled. | <a>Broker</a> | Immutable |
| <dfn>Payment</dfn> | A immutable object that represents the original payment to the <a>Seller</a> for the initial `Order`. Although modelling the <a>Payment</a> is outside the scope of this specification, it is recommended that one payment exists for each `Order`. | <a>Payment Provider</a> | Immutable |
| <dfn>Refund</dfn> | An immutable object that represents each refund made against the <a>Payment</a>, up to the <a>Payment</a>'s total amount | <a>Payment Provider</a> | Immutable |




## Invoices and Tax receipts

Due to the variety of business models in use in OpenActive, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT send receipts directly to the <a>Customer</a> for `AgentBroker` and `ResellerBroker` bookings.

For each successful `Order` operation (where **C1**, **C2** and **B** together constitute a successful Order Creation operation), the <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a new <a>Invoice</a> in the form of a tax receipt, on the basis of the <a>Orders feed</a> contents. To ensure that the <a>Customer</a> is provided with the correct tax receipt, if `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` is provided in an `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a new or updated <a>Invoice</a> and either (a) send a tax receipt representation of the <a>Invoice</a> to the <a>Customer</a> and/or (b) offer a means to allow the <a>Customer</a> to easily retrieve a full tax receipt representation of the specific version of the  <a>Invoice</a> at any future date for any previous booking made. As it is ultimately the <a>Seller</a>'s responsibility to send tax receipts, they need to be confident that the <a>Broker</a> is making tax information available to its customers in an accurate and timely manner.

The tax receipt sent by the <a>Broker</a> MUST comply with any legal requirements of the jurisdiction of operation.

Note by following specification, for all broker modes where a <a>Seller</a> may need to supply a tax receipt manually for any reason, the <a>Seller</a> will have the details of the <a>Customer</a> and the transaction enough to generate the most recent tax receipt.


## Payments and Refunds

Although the details of <a>Payments</a> and <a>Refunds</a> are not in the scope of this specification, a single <a>Payment</a> MUST be related to each `Order`, and a unique reference to this <a>Payment</a> MUST be included in the `Payment` `identifier` of the `Order` sent to the <a>Booking System</a>. Note that this <a>Payment</a> is permitted to represent a virtual <a>Payment</a> consolidating a number of actual **Payments** to allow for a wide variety of <a>Payment</a> methods. In the case where the <a>Seller</a> is paid monthly, the <a>Payment</a> may also represent a reference to a future invoice against which the eventual <a>Payment</a> will be paid. In all cases the `Payment` `identifier` MUST be uniquely resolvable for audit purposes.

## Tax calculation

### Business-to-consumer tax calculation by Booking System is mandatory

For `AgentBroker` and `NoBroker` modes, where the customer is of type `Person` and a tax receipt is usually generated by the <a>Booking System</a>, the tax calculation and associated properties this specification MUST be implemented by the <a>Booking System</a> (even if the resulting tax amount is zero).

### Business-to-business tax calculation by Booking System is optional

Tax calculation at the <a>Booking System</a> is OPTIONAL when the `brokerRole` of `ResellerBroker` is specified, or when a customer of type `Organization` is specified. If tax calculation is not supported for a `ResellerBroker`, `unitTaxSpecification` and `totalPaymentTaxSpecification` MUST NOT be included, and the `taxMode` `https://openactive/TaxNet` MUST be returned in the `OrderQuote` and `Order` (i.e. explicitly not including tax).

This allows tax to be calculated by the `ResellerBroker` or business <a>Customer</a> and reconciled outside of this specification.

Note that for business-to-business sales for a <a>Seller</a> with `taxMode` of the `organizer` or `provider` set to `https://openactive/TaxGross`, the `Offer`s available in the opportunity data will still be calculated as tax-inclusive for a business-to-consumer sale, and so MUST be presented by the <a>Broker</a> as such, with the business-to-business tax calculation occurring during the booking flow. If the usecase of presenting the correct price up-front gains traction, additional price data must be made available as part of the openly published opportunity data to resolve this shortcoming.

## Tax mode

The `taxMode` (`https://openactive/TaxNet` or `https://openactive/TaxGross`) is REQUIRED to be specified at the <a>Seller</a> level, and MUST be reflected within the `Organization` that is included in the REQUIRED `organizer` or `provider` properties within opportunity data specified in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]. It MUST also be consistent for all `Order`s originating from that <a>Seller</a>.

Note that `taxMode` only effects the interpretation of the `price` of the `Offer`. `totalPaymentDue` is always Gross (tax inclusive), and `unitTaxSpecification` and `totalTaxSpecification` include only the taxes themselves so are uneffected.

| `taxMode`                                              | `https://openactive/TaxNet` | `https://openactive/TaxGross` |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Price displayed                                        | Excludes tax                | Includes all applicable taxes assuming a `Person` as a `customer` |
| Currencies usually associated                          | USD                         | EUR, AUD, GBP                 |
| Example price of opportunity before tax                | 10.00                       | 10.00                         |
| Example tax rate                                       | 0.2                         | 0.2                           |
| Price displayed to Customer during browsing (`Offer`)  | 10.00                       | 12.00                         |
| Total paid by Customer (`totalPaymentDue`)             | 12.00                       | 12.00                         |


## Free opportunities

Free opportunities, defined by those with at least one `Offer` with a `price` of `0`, MUST follow the same workflow as paid opportunities, except with no interaction with a <a>Payment Provider</a>, and no `payment` included in the Order Creation request.

For free `Offer`s publishers MAY not include `priceCurrency`. If a `priceCurrency` is not available then brokers SHOULD display "Free" or equivalent when displaying a zero price.


## Offer overrides

The unit price of an OrderItem may be overridden to allow for business models with dynamic or variable pricing.

An `OfferOverride` type may be supplied to the `acceptedOffer` property at **C1**, **C2** and **B**. When an `OfferOverride` is used, it must be used consistently between **C2** and **B** to OrderQuote, it must be used by the booking system instead of acceptedOffer to calculate the tax and totals.

The `unitTaxSpecification` is calculated by the booking system exactly as it would be for an standard `Offer`. The `price` of the `OfferOverride` may be zero, and also may be higher or lower than the available `Offer`s that exist in the <a>Booking System</a>.

`OfferOverride` MUST NOT be used when `isAccessibleForFree` is `true`, as free events cannot be overridden. Note that <a>Booking Systems</a> that only offer free opportunities MUST NOT implement `OfferOverride` support, and must always throw an error when it is used.

<pre class="example" title="Example of OfferOverride">
  "acceptedOffer": {
    "type": "OfferOverride",
    "description": "Winger space for Speedball.",
    "name": "Speedball winger position",

    "priceCurrency": "GBP"

# Order Operations

## Opportunity Selection

Before entering into the Booking Flow, pairs of appropriate `acceptedOffer` and `orderedItem` must be selected by the <a>Customer</a>.

The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` and `remainingUses` properties in the opportunity data are up-to-date, and only include places already booked and *not* places currently reserved by leases.

### Definition of an Open Booking 'bookable' opportunity

An opportunity of type `Event`, `ScheduledSession`, `HeadlineEvent`, `Slot` or `CourseInstance` is deemed to be <dfn>bookable</dfn> via the Open Booking API if:

- `availableChannel` of a valid `Offer` includes `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingPrepayment`.

- The `endDate` is not already in the past (note that bookings are still possible after the `startDate`).

- The `eventStatus` of the `Event`, `ScheduledSession`, or `Slot` is not `https://schema.org/EventCancelled` or `https://schema.org/EventPostponed`.

- The `remainingAttendeeCapacity` or `remainingUses` is greater than the number required.

- The `potentialAction` of dataset site includes an `OpenBookingAction` object.

- The `validFromBeforeStartDate` duration (if provided) subtracted from the `startDate` in the past. This allows for a "bookahead" window to be specified.

- The `taxMode` (`https://openactive/TaxNet` or `https://openactive/TaxGross`) is specified within the `Organization` that is included in the REQUIRED `organizer` or `provider` properties.

- The <a>Broker</a> has machine readable permission to access the relevant instance of a compliant Open Booking API provided by the <a>Booking System</a> via an API key or similar token.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT attempt to book an opportunity that is not <a>bookable</a> by the above criteria. The <a>Booking System</a> MUST return an error if an `Order` is submitted that contains activities that are not <a>bookable</a>, and include an `error` against each `OrderItem` in the `OrderQuote` that is not <a>bookable</a>.

Note that although the <a>Customer</a> may be ineligible to attend a <a>bookable</a> opportunity based on the `genderRestriction` or `ageRange`, this specification encourages the <a>Broker</a> NOT to capture gender and age data from the <a>Customer</a> and NOT to enforce validation of these restrictions, but instead to prominently display any restrictions in the booking process to ensure that the <a>Customer</a> is aware of these.

There may be more restrictions placed by a <a>Seller</a> on a booking. For example, it may be that one of the party must be over a certain age as a supervising adult if some of the party are minors. It is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> and <a>Seller</a> to make such restrictions available as `oa:attendeeInstructions` on the `SessionSeries`, `FacilityUse`, `Event`, `HeadlineEvent` or `CourseInstance`, and the <a>Broker</a> MUST display these instructions clearly during the booking process.


### Applicable `Offer`s

<dfn>Applicable `Offer`s</dfn> are a complete set of `Offers` for an opportunity, deduced from inheritance following the parent/child relationship defined by the `superEvent`/`subEvent` properties for all types that subclass `schema:Event`, and defined by the `facilityUse`/`event` properties for `oa:FacilityUse` and `oa:Slot`.

The following recursive algorithm should be applied to calculate applicable offers:

1. The applicable set of offers is initialised with the `offers` property of the <a>bookable</a> opportunity.
2. If a parent is available for a <a>bookable</a> opportunity, the applicable set of offers MUST also include all `Offer`s specified in the `offers` property of the parent, where the `identifier` of that `Offer` does not match an existing applicable offer. This allows `Offer`s to be overridden in the child using the `identifier` attribute.
3. Step 2 is repeated for each parent recursively.
4. The <a>Broker</a> MUST then filter this applicable set to provide a set of `Offers` which are current (based on `validFromBeforeStartDate`) and are available to the <a>Customer</a> through the <a>Broker</a> (based on `availableChannel`).
5. The <a>Broker</a> MAY additionally filter based on the `Offer`s that apply to the customer, for example based on `ageRange` if specified in the `Offer`. This specification provides no guidance as to how the filtering should be performed, however it recommends against gathering additional personal data about the <a>Customer</a> in order to restrict `Offer`s presented, and instead advocates clear messaging regarding the restrictions of each `Offer` to allow the <a>Customer</a> to make an informed decision.


## Amending the OrderQuote before **B**

The <a>Broker</a> MAY call **C1** and MUST call **C2** when the <a>Customer</a> updates their basket to add and remove items.

When repeated calls to **C1** or **C2** are made with the same UUID, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST expire the leases of items that have been removed from the basket.

All leases may be cancelled by submitting an `OrderQuote` with the same UUID but without any `orderItem`s as either **C1** or **C2**. The <a>Broker</a> SHOULD make a reasonable attempt to cancel all leases when it is aware that a <a>Customer</a> has abandoned their journey. For <a>Booking Systems</a> that have not implemented leasing, an `OrderQuote` without any `orderItem`s can simply be ignored.

## Cancellation after **B**

Either the whole `Order` or individual `OrderItem`s within the `Order` may be cancelled after **B**, however `OrderItem`s cannot be replaced or added to an existing `Order` within this version of the specification.

The cancellation may be requested by either the <a>Customer</a> or the <a>Seller</a>, and results in an updated `Order` item on the <a>Orders feed</a>. Once a cancellation status is placed on an `OrderItem` within an `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> it is assumed by the <a>Booking System</a> to have been processed, and it MUST NOT be reversed. A new `Order` will need to created to reinstate the booking.

<div class="issue" data-number="97"></div>

### Customer requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="customercancelled.png" alt="Customer requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Customer requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

To cancel an existing OrderItem, the <a>Broker</a> MUST:

1. Use the latest state of the `Order` from the <a>Orders feed</a> to determine which `OrderItem`s may be cancelled. If `allowSimpleCancellation` is `true` and `latestCancellationBeforeStartDate` subtracted from the opportunity `startDate` is in the future, a PATCH against the `OrderItem` `id` with a body of `{ "orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled" }` MUST succeed.

2. Inform the <a>Customer</a> of the expected refund before they commit to cancellation, where the value of the refund for each `OrderItem` MUST be equal to:
- For `taxMode` of `https://openactive/TaxNet`: the sum of the `price` in the `acceptedOffer` and all the prices in `unitTaxSpecification`.
- For `taxMode` of `https://openactive/TaxGross`: the `price` in the `acceptedOffer`.

3. Submit a PATCH for each `OrderItem` to be cancelled using the URL `id` of the `OrderItem` from the feed with a body of `{ "orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled" }`. On success, a 204 response will be received, without any body. On failure a 5xx response will be received with an error message.

4. Process any refunds based on the resulting updates to the <a>Orders feed</a>. Successfully cancelled `OrderItems` will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled`. Note refunds MUST NOT be processed except in response to updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

To cancel an entire `Order`, a PATCH request must be made to each `OrderItem` within it individually. To minimise the number of updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>, it is recommended that multiple DELETEs are sent in quick succession.

Note that there is no provision for a <a>Customer</a> to cancel an `Order` after the cancellation window specified by `latestCancellationBeforeStartDate`, yet they may wish to do this out of politeness even though no refund is possible, with the benefit that their place may be taken by another participant.

<div class="issue" data-number="92"></div>

### Seller requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="sellercancelled.png" alt="Seller requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Seller requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

`OrderItems` cancelled by the Seller will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and will optionally include a `cancellationMessage`. Refunds MUST be processed in response to the resulting updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and the <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified with the `cancellationMessage` if provided.



## Notifications, updates and refunds

An <dfn>Orders feed</dfn>, which is a secure [[RPDE]] feed of `Order`s, MUST be provided by the <a>Booking System</a>, with the contents of the feed specific to the authenticating <a>Broker</a>. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of <a>Booking Systems</a>, even when changes are made outside of the <a>Broker</a>.

This also allows the <a>Broker</a> to handle refunds to cancellations, and process notifications to <a>Customers</a> in a consistent way.

### Booking System: Updating the Orders feed

The <a>Booking System</a> must ensure that the `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system, for the properties included in the feed. Hence any change to any property within an `Order` in the feed must result in a change to the `modified` property associated with that `Order`.

In order to allow a natural batching of updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>, where multiple cancellations may be made across multiple `Order`s for the same <a>Customer</a>, cancellation updates made to `Order`s in the feed by the <a>Booking System</a> MUST be posted with a modified date 30 seconds into the future. The following query will easily exclude such updates while still meeting the [[RPDE]] specification:

<pre class="example sql" title="Example of RPDE query with natural batching">
  --include first part of WHERE clause only if @afterTimestamp and @afterId provided
     WHERE (
          (modified = @afterTimestamp
                AND id > @afterId)
          OR (modified > @afterTimestamp)
        )
        AND modified <= GETDATE()
  ORDER BY modified,
           id
</pre>

Note that this delay of cancellation requests being processed by the <a>Broker</a> also mitigates the unlikely race condition of an `Order` that is created and then immediately cancelled by the <a>Booking System</a>, which would result in the <a>Broker</a> receiving an unrecognised `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

### Broker: Processing the Orders feed

The <a>Broker</a> MUST maintain an up-to-date store of `Order`s received from the <a>Booking System</a>. Each `Order` received is compared to the last `Order` stored, and any differences between the old and new content trigger notifications and refunds to the <a>Customer</a>, as well as updating the <a>Broker</a>'s store.

Hence it is important for the <a>Broker</a> to consider their store of `Order`s as durable, and not simply a cache, to ensure their customers always get relevant notifications.

Note that the properties included in the <a>Orders feed</a> and the `Order` response from the Order Creation call MAY be a subset of the `Order` request to **B** (effectively making the Orders feed a series of PATCH requests for the <a>Broker</a>), and hence any additional properties required (including properties that are OPTIONAL in the `Order` response but that were used to create the `Order`) SHOULD be stored alongside the `Order` by the <a>Broker</a> during **B**.


### New `Order`s

New `Order`s MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a> based on the response to the Order Creation call, but only stored with a success state on successful completion of the Booking Flow

New `Order`s are not included in the feed until they have been updated at least once. This minimises the volume of `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and allows the polling frequency of the feed to be greatly reduced, which reduces the overall load on the <a>Booking System</a>. It also removes any race conditions between **B** completing and Order Creation updates from the <a>Orders feed</a> being received.

Hence all `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> will always be recognised by the <a>Broker</a> as updates to an existing stored `Order`, and the <a>Broker</a> should treat any unrecognised `Order`s in the feed as a serious implementation error.


### Cancellation, refund calculation and notification

Regardless of the source of the cancellation, the process for refunding and notifying the <a>Customer</a> and updating the <a>Broker</a>'s records is exactly the same.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST process refunds for each new cancellation found in the feed, and it is the <a>Broker</a>'s responsibility to continually retry failed refund processing and escalate any processing failure to the <a>Customer</a> accordingly. Note that the <a>Orders feed</a> is "fire and forget" for the <a>Booking System</a>: once an `OrderItem` is updated with a cancellation status in the <a>Orders feed</a>, the status MUST not be reversed, and is assumed by the <a>Booking System</a> to be processed.

For `Order`s found with `OrderItem`s that contain `orderItemStatus` with new `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled` or `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` values, the new `totalPaymentDue` value of the `Order` must be made to equal the value of the associated <a>Payment</a> less any <a>Refunds</a>, by creating an additional <a>Refunds</a> if necessary.

The <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified after a refund is successfully processed, using the `orderItemStatus` to indicate the source of the cancellation.

If refund processing takes longer than 15 minutes, and a new status of `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` was detected by the <a>Broker</a>, then the <a>Customer</a> must be notified immediately of a cancellation ahead of the notification of the completed refund. This ensures the <a>Seller</a> can rely on the <a>Broker</a> as a notification channel in the event of cancellation. The <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified with the `cancellationMessage` for the `OrderItem` if provided.

Note that the <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified in the event of all cancellations, even if no refund is due for free opportunities.


### Change of logistics notifications

The `orderedItem` within the `OrderItem` of the <a>Orders feed</a> includes an `id` reference to an opportunity, which may be found and cross-referenced with other sources of opportunity data, for example an [[RPDE]] open feed.

This specification does not require the <a>Orders feed</a> to include the full contents of the opportunities within the `orderedItem`, and hence the <a>Broker</a> MUST monitor the opportunity data feeds for this information and MUST provide a notification to the <a>Customer</a> for substantive changes to the opportunity (e.g. changes to `startDate`).

<div class="issue" data-number="100"></div>

## Amending the Order after **B**

`OrderItem`s cannot be replaced or added to an existing `Order` within this version of the specification. A new `Order` must be created, and the old `Order` cancelled.

For the common case of rescheduling a `SessionSeries` or `FacilityUse` booking, the following steps are recommended for the <a>Broker</a>:

1. Request an `OrderQuote` for the new `orderItem`s with a new UUID, using **C2**.

2. Check the latest stored state of `Order`s from the <a>Orders feed</a> to ensure that old `orderItem` `allowSimpleCancellation`.

3. Clearly display messaging to the <a>Customer</a> that explains that this transaction will involve a refund and new purchase, and so they will expect a refund for the old item and a new transaction for the new one. Information should be displayed to the <a>Customer</a> if any price difference exists between the two Orders, for the <a>Customer</a> to confirm.

4. Request new payment details from the <a>Customer</a> and Authorise the amount specified by **C2**, then DELETE the old `orderItem`, and if successful, complete **B** as normal.

The new `Order` is completed as described in the new booking process, and the existing `Order` is cancelled with the refund processed as described in the next section.


## Delivery of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy

The <a>Broker</a> MUST make the <a>Customer</a> aware of and assent to any `termsOfService`
provided within the `seller`, `broker`, and `bookingService` (which may include
Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy) before the <a>Customer</a> completes **B**.

Since, during booking, the details of the <a>Customer</a> are provided to the
<a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Seller</a>, the <a>Broker</a> SHOULD inform the
<a>Customer</a> of this any implications with respect to GDPR and any other
data protection legislation.

Note that `termsOfService` may only be specified at the `seller`, `broker` or
`bookingService` level, and may not be provided for a specific `Offer` or `OrderItem`.

<pre class="example" title="Properties for Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy">
  "termsOfService": [
    {
      "type": "Terms",
      "name": "Privacy Policy",
      "url": "https://example.com/privacy-policy"
    },
    {
      "type": "Terms",
      "name": "Terms and Conditions",
      "url": "https://example.com/terms-and-conditions"
    }
  ]
</pre>

The URLs in the example are only illustrative.

<div class="issue" data-number="95"></div>

## Extension point for including payments

In some limited circumstances it might also be desirable for an Open Booking API to act as a facade over a Booking System, Payment Processor, and Invoicing systems. For these circumstances the specification allows the API defined here to be extended via additional OPTIONAL properties in the `Payment` type used in `B` in a custom namespace, to facilitate a full payment.

<pre class="example" title="Example of Payment extension point">
  "payment": {
    "type": "Payment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "paymentMethod": "stripe:StripePayment",
    "stripe:token": "tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf"
  },
</pre>

Note that due to the variety of business models available in the OpenActive ecosystem, conformance to this specification requires that the use of any native payment functionality in the <a>Booking System</a> be optional, and the <a>Booking System</a> MUST always accept a lack of `paymentMethod` as indication of an external **Payment Processor** being used. To maximise flexibility of this extension point, `identifier` and `name` within `Payment` are NOT REQUIRED if `paymentMethod` is specified.


## Extension point for access control

For opportunities based at locations that have access control, it is RECOMMENDED that `OrderItem` include unique access control data within `accessToken`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of accessToken">
  "accessToken": [
    {
      "type": "Barcode",
      "text": "0123456789",
      "bookwhen:codeType": "code128"
    }
  ],
</pre>

Due to the variety of Barcode and QR code formats available, the specification expects the `Barcode` to include additional properties using a custom namespace, enough to allow the barcode to be reproduced by the <a>Broker</a>. This will help inform future versions of the specification.

# Endpoints

This API has been defined around the concept of URL discovery. This
allows resource URLs which match the naming conventions of each <a>Booking System</a>.

## Paths and Verbs

Due to URL discovery, the paths of the endpoints below are illustrative, as the actual paths may vary provided they are consistent within an implementation.

A summary of endpoints defined by this specification is provided below:

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path                                     |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Order Creation         | REQUIRED    | Order            | PUT       | `/orders/{uuid}`                                 |
| Order Deletion         | REQUIRED    | Order            | DELETE    | `/orders/{uuid}`                                 |
| Orders RPDE Feed       | REQUIRED    | Orders feed      | GET       | `/orders-rpde`                                   |
| OrderItem Cancellation | REQUIRED    | OrderItem        | PATCH     | `/orders/{uuid}/order-items/{order-item-id}`     |
| Order Status           | OPTIONAL    | Order            | GET       | `/orders/{uuid}`                                 |


<div class="issue" data-number="98"></div>



## Request and Response

This section includes request and response examples for each of the endpoints specified in this API.

### Order Creation

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path                                     |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Order Creation         | REQUIRED    | Order            | PUT       | `/orders/{uuid}`                                 |

The <dfn>Order Creation</dfn> is an essential part of the Booking Flow, allowing creation of an `Order` via an `OrderQuote`.

It is not possible for opportunities from different <a>Sellers</a> or with different <a>Brokers</a> or on behalf of different <a>Customers</a> to be combined in the same `Order`.

Note that the `broker` property in the request body is to help the <a>Booking System</a> to clarify who is making request and to help them in situations such as queries to allow reconciliation of payments. It is not designed as any part of an authentication which MUST be performed outside of the JSON body of the request. Authentication tokens MUST NOT be present within the `broker` property of the submitted JSON.

In the situation where a middleware is used for various <a>Brokers</a>, independently of API key provisioning at the <a>Booking System</a> level (which in some systems is a lengthly and time-consuming process), the `broker` property SHOULD contain the details of the end-user <a>Broker</a> rather than the middleware.


#### `orderQuantity` expansion

`orderQuantity` within `OrderItem` is only used during Order Creation, and is not persisted, as follows:

- For `OrderQuote` request, `OrderQuote` response, and `Order` request the `OrderItem`s MUST be unique based on the `id` of their `acceptedOffer` and the `id` of their `orderedItem`, and `orderQuantity` MUST be used to specify more than one is desired.
- For `Order` response, and the <a>Orders feed</a>, the `OrderItems` MUST NOT include `orderQuantity`, and instead `OrderItem`s must be duplicated according to their original `orderQuanity`, with a unique `id` provided for each resulting `OrderItem`.

This allows `OrderItem`s to be cancelled individually once the `Order` has been created, and errors regarding capacity to be attributed appropriately during Order Creation.

| Scenario              | `orderQuantity` status | Unique `OrderItem` key                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `OrderQuote` request  | REQUIRED               | Composite of `acceptedOffer` and `orderedItem` |
| `OrderQuote` response | REQUIRED               | Composite of `acceptedOffer` and `orderedItem` |
| `Order` request       | REQUIRED               | Composite of `acceptedOffer` and `orderedItem` |
| `Order` response      | -                      | `id` of `OrderItem`                            |
| <a>Orders feed</a>    | -                      | `id` of `OrderItem`                            |


#### `OrderQuote`

A PUT request to the Order Creation endpoint of the <a>Booking System</a> with an object of type `OrderQuote` will return a `OrderQuote` which represents a "dry run" of the booking, with the state of the `Order` identical to if request of type `Order` be made, without any side effects (with the exception of optional leasing).

Note that the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT store any personal information of the `customer` provided for the `OrderQuote` past the expiry of any associated lease created.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationRequest">
</pre>

If successful the <a>Booking System</a> will respond with an OrderQuote:

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationResponse">
</pre>

If there are any issues with the `orderedItem`s provided in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response (as the error is expected to be resolved, and the request resubmitted, as per [[RFC2616]]), with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem`. Note that `totalPaymentDue` and `totalTaxSpecification` MUST be calculated excluding any `OrderItem`s that include `error`s.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example OrderItem error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationOrderItemErrorResponse">
</pre>

If there are issues with other properties of the `OrderQuote` outside of `orderedItem`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a JSON-LD response which includes only the appropriate `OpenBookingError` and the appropriate status code.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: OrderQuote example failure response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationErrorResponse">
</pre>


#### `Order`

A PUT request to the Order Creation endpoint of the <a>Booking System</a> with an object of type `Order` will create the `Order` and complete the booking from the point of the view of the <a>Booking System</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: Order example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationRequest">
</pre>

If successful the server will respond with the location of a newly created `Order` resource:

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: Order example minimal response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationResponse">
</pre>

Both `OrderQuote` and `Order` responses can optionally reflect back properties provided by the <a>Booking System</a> for completeness, for example:

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: Order example full response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationFullResponse">
</pre>

If there are issues any properties of the `Order`, including the `orderedItem`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `400 Bad Request` response which includes only the appropriate `Error`. The <a>Broker</a> is expected to retry the `OrderQuote` to get specific `orderedItem` level errors.


### Order Deletion

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path                                     |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Order Deletion         | REQUIRED    | Order            | DELETE    | `/orders/{uuid}`                                 |

Deleting an `Order` allows for the whole Booking Flow to be reversed for fatal error and testing scenarios.

When an `Order` is deleted the <a>Booking System</a> must soft delete it as if it was not created, rolling back the Booking Flow.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT use Order Deletion for cancellation, but instead only use it in the unusual case of a fatal error or testing. An appropriate approach for cancellation is
defined elsewhere.

The corresponding `Order` MUST be marked as `deleted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Order Deletion: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderDeletionRequest">

|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Orders RPDE Feed       | REQUIRED    | Orders feed      | GET       | `/orders-rpde`                                   |

|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| OrderItem Cancellation | REQUIRED    | OrderItem        | PATCH     | `/orders/{uuid}/order-items/{order-item-id}`     |

<pre class="example" title="OrderItem Cancellation: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderItemCancellationRequest">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="OrderItem Cancellation: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderItemCancellationResponse">
</pre>

### Order Status

A <a>Booking System</a> MAY provide an endpoint to allow a <a>Broker</a> to retrieve complete `Order`s. In future versions of the specification, endpoints may be provided which permit a <a>Broker</a> to see all `Order`s created by a <a>Customer</a>. In this current implementation, the <a>Broker</a> MUST keep its own record of `Order`s as described elsewhere in this specification, and not rely on this OPTIONAL Order Status endpoint.

| Endpoint Name          | Status      | Resource         | HTTP Verb | Example Path                                     |
|------------------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Order Status           | OPTIONAL    | Order            | GET       | `/orders/{uuid}`                                 |

<pre class="example" title="Order Status: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderStatusRequest">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Order Status: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderStatusResponse">
</pre>



### URL discovery

The URL for the initial Order Creation action MUST be discoverable by parsing the
`OpenBookingAction` defined in the `potentialAction` property of the published
`Dataset` embedded within dataset site.

The `EntryPoint` object MUST state the `url` of the Order Creation endpoint, and MUST
contain the `encodingType` and the `httpMethod` as `PUT`.

</pre>

Since discovery of URLs is an implicit part of the specification, <a>Brokers</a>
SHOULD avoid hard-coding URLs for specific actions into their applications and
client libraries. <a>Brokers</a> SHOULD use most applicable URL discovered at the
point in the workflow they are currently in - e.g. not use a cached URL that has
been previously successfully used. They should also not attempt to create URLs
for a specific action based on patterns within previously used URLs.

It is the responsibility of <a>Booking Systems</a> to advertise the URL for
further activity in the booking workflow at the point of need. For example they
MUST advertise the URL for the `OrderItem` resource in the Orders <a>Orders feed</a>
by including the `id` property within the `OrderItem`.

### `schema:Person`

For business-to-consumer transactions, the `customer` MUST be a `schema:Person`.

| Property                                                           | Broker Request | Booking System Response | Type | Notes |

Note that the `Person` is not sent to the <a>Broker</a>, only received by the <a>Booking System</a>, to avoid any inadvertent data sharing between **Brokers** when the properties of the `Person` are updated. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the personal data received by the <a>Booking System</a> be treated as a "guest checkout" and is not used to create a <a>Customer</a> record in the <a>Booking System</a>.

In this current iteration of the Booking API specification, the programmatic creation of <a>Customer</a> records on the <a>Booking System</a> by the <a>Broker</a> is considered to be out of scope.

For conformance with this specification the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT require more data about the <a>Customer</a> than is specified as REQUIRED properties above.

# Common Requirements

This section defines some common functionality that applies to the design of the
whole API.

## Media types


Custom media types are used in this API to allow clients to choose the format
of the data they receive, and for <a>Booking Systems</a> to stipulate which versions
of the specification they support.

<a>Booking Systems</a> MAY choose to support additional media types but MUST support the
media type(s) defined by this specification.

Media types will conform to the following pattern:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json; model=[m], booking=[b], rpde=[r]
```

The current media type is:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json; model=2.0, booking=1.0, rpde=1.0
```

**Brokers** specifying a media type without a version, such as:

```
application/vnd.openactive+json
```

will receive data in in the most current format.

If you are building an application as a <a>Broker</a> and care about the stability
of the response, or have a client application which is tied to a specific
version you should always try to use a media type containing the version number.


<div class="issue" data-number="93"></div>


## Response formats

Requests and response documents exchanged via this API will all be valid
[[!JSON-LD]] documents, with the exception of the <a>Orders feed</a>, where only documents
included in the `data` property are valid [[!JSON-LD]].

The [[!JSON-LD]] documents MUST include a [[!JSON-LD]] `context` that refers
to the [[!OpenActive-Vocabulary]] as follows:

<pre class="example" title="minimal JSON-LD document">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/"
}
</pre>

Unless otherwise specified the request and response documents MUST conform to
the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data model.


## Errors

Error responses MUST be served using an appropriate HTTP 4XX status code or HTTP 5XX status code specified in the model.

All error responses from this API MUST be returned in a JSON-LD format subclass of the `OpenBookingError` using a content type of `application/vnd.openactive+json` (optionally including any version parameters).

<pre class="example" title="Error response example" data-transform="dataExampleErrorResponse">
</pre>


## Rate Limiting

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY choose to apply rate limiting for each unique set of authentication credentials, in which case they MUST adhere to the following.

All rate-limited responses from this API MUST return a JSON-LD format `TooManyRequestsError` object using a content type of `application/vnd.openactive+json` (optionally including any version parameters).

The response MUST also include the `Retry-After` HTTP Header with a value set to the number of seconds after which the <a>Broker</a> SHOULD retry as per [[RFC2616]] section 14.37.

<pre class="example" title="Rate limited response example" data-transform="dataExampleRateLimitResponse">
</pre>


## Security

All HTTP requests and responses SHOULD be secured using SSL.


## Authentication

### API level authentication and data security

All of the API transactions described in this document MUST require authentication.

The content and data available to all endpoints provided by the <a>Booking System</a> MUST be specific to the authentication credentials, to ensure that bookings are secure. It is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> to ensure that only authentication credentials that created an `Order` can amend and cancel the `Order`.

Note that a client using the same authentication credentials may represent more than one <a>Broker</a>, and the <a>Booking System</a> MUST make no assumptions regarding which <a>Broker</a> is being represented by a particular set of credentials. For the avoidance of doubt: the same <a>Broker</a> accessing a <a>Booking System</a> using two sets of credentials MUST not be able to access `Order`'s created by one set of credentials when using the other.

In terms of implementation, all data partitioning and security MUST be based on the authentication credentials; the `broker` property within the `Order` is for information only.

This specification does not mandate a particular authentication method, but its recommendation is that implementers SHOULD consider using [[OAuth2]] as it is well-defined, widely supported and can be used in a variety of different application flows (e.g. via a Javascript web application or between servers).

Other server-to-server authentication mechanisms such as basic authentication, API key or bearer token based mechanisms are also appropriate.


### Customer level authentication

OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) is recommended as standard way of verifying the identity of customer. It is a thin layer that sits atop OAuth2.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that `Order`s created by a specific <a>Customer</a> SHOULD NOT be able to be changed by any other <a>Customer</a>. It is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to ensure that subsequent requests to an `Order` should only be initiated by the <a>Customer</a> which created the `Order`.
