# Introduction

The document is an output of the [OpenActive W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/openactive/). As part of the [OpenActive](https://www.openactive.io) initiative, the community group is developing standards that will promote the publication and use of [open opportunity data](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#categories-of-physical-activity-data) in helping people to become more physically active.

The Community Group have already published specifications that define standard data models ([[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]) and support the publication and harvesting of data in standard formats ([[RPDE]]). This existing work helps increase the discovery of opportunities for people to get more active.

An <dfn>Opportunity</dfn> (e.g. "Yoga Tuesday 14th March at 7pm") in the context of this specification is a specific instance of an [`Event`](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#describing-events-code-schema-event-code-) (or subclass of `Event`) that a <a>Customer</a> can attend to participate in physical activity: a `ScheduledSession` within a `SessionSeries`, a `Slot` within a `FacilityUse`, a `HeadlineEvent` or a `CourseInstance` (or an `Event` within a `HeadlineEvent` or `CourseInstance`). Each <a>Opportunity</a> has associated [`Offer`](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#describing-offers-code-schema-offer-code-)s (e.g. "Junior (8-18) £9"), which may be free, and describe the commercial means of accessing the <a>Opportunity</a>.

<dfn>Opportunity Data</dfn> in the context of this specification is openly published data pertaining to <a>Opportunities</a>, 
accessible via [[RPDE]] feed(s).

This specification builds on the previous work of the Community Group by defining an HTTP API that can be implemented by <a>Booking Systems</a> that are publishing <a>Opportunity Data</a>. By
allowing third-party applications ("<a>Brokers</a>") to place bookings in their systems, it becomes possible for more people to participate in events or make use of leisure and sporting facilities.

The specification defines the flow of HTTP requests and responses between the
<a>Booking System</a> (server) and the <a>Broker</a> (client). This includes
definitions of the overall application flow, detailed request and response
formats and the potential error conditions that applications may encounter. A high-level summary of these and their relationship to each other is provided in the [Booking Flow overview](#booking-flow-overview), below.


## Scope and requirements

The focus of the initial versions of this specification will be on the simplest use cases that support guest checkout bookings via a <a>Broker</a>.

The core functionality includes:

* __Guest checkout__ – making a booking on behalf of a <a>Customer</a> who is assumed to be unknown to the <a>Booking System</a> and <a>Seller</a>, and who does not expect a persistent account to be created for them with the <a>Seller</a>.
* __Pricing and availability__ – checking the price and current availabilty of an event or for the use of a facility.
* __Booking__ – recording bookings in the <a>Booking System</a>.
* __Tax__ – tax calculation by the <a>Booking System</a> exposed to the <a>Broker</a>.
* __Multiple order items__ - bookings for multiple events and for groups of attendees.
* __Child booking__ - booking on behalf of a child.
* __Dynamic pricing__ – allowing the <a>Broker</a> to vary pricing, where agreed with the <a>Seller</a>.
* __Cancellation__ – <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a> initiated cancellation .
* __Access control__ - text, images and barcodes that can be used by the <a>Customer</a> to access the activity.

Additional optional functionality includes:

* __Leasing__ – temporarily reserving spaces for a <a>Customer</a> to attend an event or
make use of a facility, whilst they are placing a booking.
* __Booking approval__ – for <a>Booking Systems</a> that support or require approval for bookings, including proposal negotiation and message exchange.
* __Attendee Details capture__ – optional capturing of attendee details.
* __Additional Details capture__ – optional capturing of additional details per-attendee for a booking.


### Out of Scope in this version

A number of additional requirements that relate to the booking of events and facilities are currently out of scope:

* Creating and managing accounts for <a>Customers</a>
* More complex pricing options, e.g. membership-based pricing
* Waiting lists for events
* Collecting marketing preferences from the <a>Customer</a>
* Mandatory business-to-business tax calculation
* Cancellation fees
* "Subscriptions" to allow a <a>Customer</a> to participate ad-hoc in a <a>Seller</a>'s activity, with such participation recorded for later reconciliation
* Refunds/cancellations after the <a>Opportunity</a> has occurred 
* Back-office systems between <a>Broker</a> and <a>Booking System</a>, such as for payment reconciliation
* Fine-grained control of <a>Opportunity</a> <a>bookability</a> in the <a>Booking System</a>
* The ability to restrict specific API functionality for a particular <a>Broker</a> 

It is possible that future versions of this specification may include support
for these or other features. Revisions will be driven by the needs of the
community, please raise feature requests via [GitHub](https://github.com/openactive/open-booking-api).


### Out of Scope by design

By design this specification will not define some types of functionality.

These have been declared as permanently out of scope because they are either
adequately covered by existing specifications, or will be covered by future
work of the OpenActive W3C Community Group.

The functionality that is currently defined as out of scope includes:

* __API authentication and security__ – while the specification recommends some best practices relating to authentication and security it does not mandate a specific means of securing an API. Implementers are free to choose the system that offers the best security for their platform and users.
* __Payment processing__ – the design assumes that all payment handling will be coordinated by the <a>Broker</a>, in a separate payment flow. <a>Brokers</a> are able to use the payment and reconciliation mechanisms that provide the best options for their <a>Sellers</a> and <a>Customers</a>.
* __API business models__ – the design is agnostic to any business models that might govern the use or provision of the API, e.g. revenue-sharing or transaction processing fees.
* __Opportunity discovery__  – finding, filtering and searching for <a>Opportunity Data</a>. This specification assumes that the client and server applications have already shared data about the relevant <a>Opportunities</a>, e.g. via an [[RPDE]] feed containing [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data.
* __API endpoint discovery__  – the means for a <a>Broker</a> to discover the API endpoints included in this specification are included in the [[Dataset-API-Discovery]] specification.

## Specification dependencies

Version 1.0 of the Open Booking specification depends on the following:
- [[RPDE]] Version 1.0
- [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] Version 2.x (where x >= 0)

Note that the dependency on the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification is only constrained to the major version release, and that the flexibility provided by supporting minor versions (which do not include breaking changes) enables implementors to take advantage of additional features as the specification evolves.


## Audience

The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:

- Software developers who want to implement the API, e.g. as part of a <a>Booking System</a>
- Software developers building client libraries or tools
- Software developers writing applications that will use the API ("<a>Brokers</a>") 

The following sections introduce terminology, concepts and requirements that
underpin the design of the API. This content might also be useful for a wider
audience, e.g. business analysts or product managers looking for a high-level
overview of the API functionality.

# Key Actors

Of all the organisations and systems involved in a transaction, the API defined
by this specification is scoped tightly to only specify interactions between the <a>Broker</a> and
<a>Booking System</a>, with high level prompts for interactions with <a>Customers</a>, <a>Sellers</a> and <a>Payment Providers</a>.

    <dd>The notional service providing payment processing between the <a>Customer</a>, <a>Broker</a> and <a>Seller</a>. Although this specification refers to the <a>Payment Provider</a> as a single notional service, it may in reality be composed of multiple connected services providing the same functionality to allow for the widest variety of business models.</dd>

# Booking Flows

This specification includes two main booking flows: a [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), and a [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval) that builds on the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow). The two flows are largely identical, with the addition of a (possibly iterative) approval step in the [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval).


## Booking flow overview 
    
Described in the broadest possible terms, the Open Booking API defined by this specification supplies the technical means whereby a <a>Broker</a> can book a <a>Customer</a> into an <a>Opportunity</a> for a physical activity, by means of an `Offer` provided by a <a>Seller</a>. Typically, although not always, a <a>Payment</a> will have to be made for this `Order`.

While this process is intuitively clear, some of its implications may be less so, and a number of common use-cases introduce a degree of additional complexity into the flow. For instance, a <a>Customer</a> will typically want to have an idea of how much a given `Offer` will cost before committing to attending an <a>Opportunity</a>. This means that before an `Order` can be created, an `OrderQuote` (a subclass of `Order`) needs to be provided. In addition, many <a>Seller</a>s will need to review their `Order`s before deciding to approve them because, for instance, they need to allocate shared resources such as caretakers to a number of <a>Customers</a>. This is the motivation for the [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval) sequence, and introduces to the flow the concept of `OrderProposal`s - another subclass of `Order`, which allows (re)modification by both parties and that requires explicit consent from both <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a> before a new `Order` is created.

The process of creating an `Order` online takes time, and for this reason some <a>Sellers</a> and <a>Brokers</a> may optionally offer their users a <a>Lease</a> - a provisional reservation of an <a>Opportunity</a>  that prevents it from being sold while the <a>Customer</a> is in the process of booking it.

Typically <a>Sellers</a> keep track of bookings by means of an automated <a>Booking System</a>. This raises the problem of ensuring consistency in the state of information between the <a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Broker</a>. This difficulty is bridged by the concept of `Order` feeds, which publish all changes made to an `Order` by the <a>Booking System</a> after its initial successful response to the client's request to create it, and which is intended for consumption only by the <a>Broker</a>.

The process of creating an `Order` will normally involve the processing of a <a>Payment</a>. While <a>Payments</a> are normally fixed, some approaches to pricing also allow for the possibility of a `DynamicPayment`, whereby the price may fluctuate based on external conditions. In addition, differences in approaches to taxation - whether because of regional variation, or because of the legal and commercial status of the <a>Broker</a>  - result in a need for some nuances in the modelling of `TaxChargeSpecification`s.

Additionally, transactions between <a>Customers</a>, <a>Brokers</a>, and <a>Sellers</a> may be subject to various legal and regulatory `Terms`, such as a `PrivacyPolicy` and `TermsOfUse`.

## Booking flow modularity

This specification is designed to provide a minimal core [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), which should be straightforward to implement.

This specification also provides optional features, which allows the minimal core implementation to be augmented depending on the <a>Booking System</a>'s requirements:
- [Leasing](#leasing) (`Lease`)
- [Attendee Details capture](#attendee-details-capture) (`https://openactive.io/OpenBookingAttendeeDetails`)
- [Additional Details capture](#additional-details-capture) (`https://openactive.io/OpenBookingIntakeForm`)
- [Minimal Proposal Implementation](#minimal-proposal-implementation) (`https://openactive.io/OpenBookingApproval`)
- [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment) (`https://openactive.io/OpenBookingNegotiation`)
- [Message Exchange](#message-exchange) (`https://openactive.io/OpenBookingMessageExchange`)


## Booking pre-conditions

In order to enter either of the booking flows described in this specification, the following pre-conditions must be met:

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST obtain <a>Opportunity Data</a> that includes descriptions of <a>Opportunities</a>, by frequently harvesting data via <a>Opportunity Data</a> [[RPDE]] open feeds provided by the <a>Booking System</a>.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST present an up-to-date view of availability data for the <a>Customer</a> to select items to book, as this data may change over time.

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` and `remainingUses` properties in the <a>Opportunity Data</a> are up-to-date.

- The <a>Customer</a> MUST have selected at least one <a>bookable</a> pair of an <a>Opportunity</a> ("Yoga Tuesday 14th 7pm") with an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) £9"). These pairs populate the `orderedItem` and `acceptedOffer` properties within the submitted `OrderItem`s, respectively.

- It is not possible for <a>Opportunities</a> from different <a>Sellers</a> or with different <a>Brokers</a> or on behalf of different <a>Customers</a> to be combined in the same `Order`.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST generate an <dfn>Order UUID</dfn>, which is a unique UUID string representation strictly as defined in [[RFC4122]].


## Simple Booking Flow

### Customer Journey
The booking journey of a <a>Customer</a> is generalised into the following logical steps:

<figure>
 <img src="userjourney.png" alt="High level customer journey">
 <figcaption>Illustration of a typical <a>Customer</a> journey.</figcaption>
</figure>

1. **Select**: <a>Customer</a> selects at least one <a>Opportunity</a> (e.g. `ScheduledSession` or `Slot`) and an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) £9")
2. **Identify**: <a>Customer</a> submits personal details and other requested details
3. **Book and Pay**: <a>Customer</a> submits payment details

Note that some or all steps may be skipped, or may not be presented to the <a>Customer</a>, e.g. if their registration or payment details are already known, or they are using a voice interface. These steps are not indicative of the user experience, and simply provide a common language around the flow.

### High-level API flow

<figure>
 <img src="bookingflow.png" alt="High level booking flow">
 <figcaption>Illustration of high level booking flow.</figcaption>
</figure>

- The <a>Broker</a> generates an <a>Order UUID</a>, which is used to uniquely identify the `OrderQuote` / `Order` throughout the process.

- After "**1. Select**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to confirm an indicative price and the availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, and retrieve a total order price. Any details that the <a>Customer</a> needs to supply to complete the booking are also specified. This is checkpoint <a><b>C1</b></a> on the diagram above.

- After "**2. Identify**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to reconfirm the price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, using all personal details required, and retrieve a total order price. Explicit consent for any terms and conditions is also captured at this stage if required. This is checkpoint <a><b>C2</b></a> on the diagram above.

- After "**3. Book and Pay**", the <a>Broker</a> first _pre-authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if required by the <a>Payment Provider</a>), then confirms the booking with the <a>Booking System</a> using an `Order` (<a><b>B</b></a> on the diagram above), and finally _captures_ the payment. The <a>Broker</a> then generates invoices, and sends the <a>Customer</a> notifications.

- The <a>Booking System</a> adds the `Order` to an <a>Orders feed</a> specific to the <a>Broker</a>, which the <a>Broker</a> reads to update its internal state, including those updates resulting from cancellations.


### Leasing

Customers may simultaneously attempt to book the same <a>Opportunity</a> (e.g. space in an event or `Slot` of a facility), and hence contend with one another for a limited number of <a>Opportunities</a>. In order to ensure that items cannot be "stolen" from a <a>Customer</a>'s "shopping basket" by another <a>Customer</a>, some <a>Booking Systems</a> use the concept of a <dfn>Lease</dfn>, a temporary reservation that provides a window during which a <a>Customer</a> can complete their customer journey and improves the user experience overall.

The design of this API supports the use of time-bound <a>Leases</a>. Using <a>Leases</a> is RECOMMENDED, however they are not required, in order to ensure a low barrier of entry for implementors of the specification.

Individually at <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a>, the <a>Booking System</a> can opt to create (or extend) a <a>Lease</a> for the <a>Broker</a>. Whether they opt to do so may depend on the <a>Booking System</a>'s capability to support <a>Leases</a>, or on the <a>Seller</a>'s configuration of the <a>Booking System</a>. 

At <a><b>C1</b></a> an <dfn>Anonymous Lease</dfn> MAY be created i.e. a <a>Lease</a> for a <a>Customer</a> that has not yet provided any personal details.

At <a><b>C2</b></a> a <dfn>Named Lease</dfn> MAY be created i.e. a <a>Lease</a> for a <a>Customer</a> who has identified themselves via personal details and other additional details. Any existing <a>Anonymous Lease</a> becomes a <a>Named Lease</a> when the customer's personal details are provided (even if the <a>Booking System</a> does not store them at this stage).
 
If a <a>Lease</a> is created at <a><b>C1</b></a> and/or <a><b>C2</b></a> it is used during <a><b>B</b></a>. However, if no <a>Lease</a> is created, or if it had expires prior to the transaction being completed, the booking completes anyway provided sufficient inventory is available.

It is RECOMMENDED that if the <a>Booking System</a> supports leasing, it also guarantees the price of each leased item for the duration of the <a>Lease</a>, so that the <a>Customer</a> is guaranteed to pay the price they have seen during <a><b>C2</b></a>.

The specification is designed to allow <a>Brokers</a> to be agnostic to <a>Leases</a>: should a <a>Booking System</a> be upgraded to support these, it can do so without affecting the <a>Broker</a>'s implementation.

By design, then, the use of <a>Leases</a> is largely transparent to the <a>Broker</a>. However, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST provide information on the <a>Lease</a> to help improve the user experience of the customer journey as follows: when a <a>Lease</a> is created, a `Lease` object MUST be returned in the `OrderQuote`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of lease">
  "lease": {
    "@type": "Lease",
    "leaseExpires": "2018-10-01T11:00:00Z"
  }
</pre>

The `leaseExpires` MAY be used to inform the <a>Customer</a> of the time they have remaining.

### High-level type flow

<figure>
 <img src="typeflow.png" alt="High level type flow">
 <figcaption>Illustration of types used during the API flow.</figcaption>
</figure>

The `OrderQuote` is an ephemeral draft of the `Order` while it is being constructed by the <a>Customer</a>.

- <a><b>C1</b></a> - `OrderQuote` without enough personal details or additional details to be accepted as an `Order`.
- <a><b>C2</b></a> - `OrderQuote` with complete and validated detail, enough to be created successfully as an `Order`.
- <a><b>B</b></a> - `Order` exists in an instantly successful state in the <a>Booking System</a>, though it transitions through `orderCreationStatus` states in the <a>Broker</a>.

### Order statuses

To simplify the implementation for the <a>Booking System</a>, the creation of an `Order` is considered atomic to the <a>Booking System</a> (it succeeds or fails at once in <a><b>B</b></a>), and by contrast is considered to consist of steps to the <a>Broker</a>. 

#### Order statuses in the Booking System

In this version of the specification the `Order` within the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT have a status, it exists atomically in a successfully created state. Although `OrderItem`s may be cancelled by either the <a>Customer</a> or the <a>Seller</a>, the `Order` itself within the <a>Booking System</a> is simply a container. The `orderStatus` property of the `Order` MUST NOT be used and is reserved for future evolution of the specification.

The `orderCreationStatus` is maintained by the <a>Broker</a> only during this flow, and MUST NOT be sent to the <a>Booking System</a>.

#### Order statuses in the Broker

Throughout "Book and Pay" section of this flow the <a>Broker</a> maintains the `orderCreationStatus` property in its copy of the `Order`, which is not sent to the <a>Booking System</a>. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to consistently rollback in the case of failure.

The `orderCreationStatus` statuses are defined as follows:
1. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized - after successful <a>Payment Authorisation</a>
2. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentDue - after successful <a><b>B</b></a>
3. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured - after successful <a>Payment Capture</a>
4. https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete - after successful <a>Invoice Generation</a> and <a>Customer Notification</a>

An `Order` MUST NOT be communicated externally by the <a>Broker</a> and other operations such as cancellation MUST NOT be possible until it has reached the `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete`, after which the `orderCreationStatus` can be ignored.


### Step-by-step process description

<figure>
 <img src="sequencediagram.png" alt="Sequence diagram">
 <figcaption>Sequence diagram showing API interactions</figcaption>
</figure>


i) "**1. Select**" - <a>Customer</a> browses <a>Broker</a> site anonymously and adds something to basket

- <a>Broker</a> MUST have determined at least one Open Booking <a>bookable</a> <a>Opportunity</a> each with an associated applicable `Offer` from the <a>Customer</a>'s browsing, using the most up-to-date <a>Opportunity Data</a>.
- <a>Broker</a> generates an <a>Order UUID</a>.
- If any catastrophic failure occurs during the booking flow (any error with status code 500, or when the request consistently returns status code 503 after a number of retries) the <a>Order UUID</a> MUST be regenerated to allow for a clean retry of the booking. The <a>Order UUID</a> MUST NOT be regenerated for expected errors (status code 4xx).

ii) <a><b>C1</b></a> - <a>Broker</a> call with `OrderQuote` including the <a>Order UUID</a>, without a `customer` object, to check availability and that the combination of items requested can be purchased, <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `OrderQuote` including any `error`s against each `OrderItem`.

- <a>Booking System</a> creates <a>Anonymous Lease</a> for that <a>Order UUID</a> if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and `totalPaymentDue` confirmation. An `OrderQuote` response with HTTP Status 200 MUST be returned if the all requested items are available.
- If a <a>Lease</a> has been created, then the `OrderQuote` in the response MUST include a `lease` property containing a valid `Lease` object.
- The `OrderQuote` response MUST include `totalPaymentDue`, which allows the <a>Broker</a> to update any UI with the total.
- The `OrderQuote` response MUST include a list of `OrderItem`s which contain their respective <a>Opportunity</a> objects, including enough detail to allow the <a>Broker</a> to communicate key information about the <a>Opportunity</a> to the <a>Customer</a> (rather than relying on the <a>Broker</a> having the most up-to-date <a>Opportunity</a> data from the open feeds at the point of purchase).
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that the data returned to the <a>Broker</a> in the `remainingAttendeeCapacity` and `remainingUses` properties are up-to-date, including places already booked and those currently reserved by any <a>Leases</a> from competing `OrderQuote`s, but excluding those places already reserved for this <a>Order UUID</a> by previous calls to <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a>.
- The `OrderQuote` response MUST specify any additional details required to complete the booking for the selected `OrderItem`s via an `orderItemIntakeForm`.
- If there are any issues with the `OrderItem`s requested in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response, with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem`. 
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST reflect back all properties defined by this specification that are supplied by the <a>Broker</a>'s request in its response, including `broker` and `brokerRole`, to acknowledge they have been recognised (even if they have not actually been stored by the <a>Booking System</a>). The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT reflect back extension properties outside of this specification unless it explicitly supports them.
- If a viable payment reconciliation route is available between the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> that requires more than just the `identifier` property of the `Payment` to be included in <a><b>B</b></a>, the `payment` property MUST be included at <a><b>C1</b></a>, as per [Payment reconciliation detail validation](#payment-reconciliation-detail-validation). This ensures that a viable payment reconciliation route is available before the <a>Customer</a> starts to enter their data.
- `OrderItem`s have no `orderItemStatus`.

iii) "**2. Identify**" - <a>Customer</a> submits personal details and any other additional details requested

- The <a>Customer</a> MUST have been informed that their personal information is being submitted to the <a>Seller</a>.
- The <a>Customer</a> MUST have been made aware of any relevant `termsOfService`, for example by displaying a link to them prominently, before submitting their personal details.
- If `requiresExplicitConsent` is `true` for any `termsOfService` then the <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if they have explicitly acted to consent to the most recently modified version of such terms. The <a>Broker</a> MAY remember the consent previously given by the <a>Customer</a> based on the `url` and `dateModified` of the `Terms`, only if `dateModified` is provided, and if consent for storing such preferences is given by the <a>Customer</a>.
- `attendee` and `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` data is be captured at this stage if specified via `attendeeDetailsRequired` and `orderItemIntakeForm` in the <a><b>C1</b></a> response, respectively.
- If [payment initiation is optional](#booking-without-payment), the <a>Customer</a> MAY be given the option to prepay or simply reserve a space without payment. Providing optionality of payment to the <a>Customer</a> is at the <a>Broker</a>'s discretion.


iv) <a><b>C2</b></a> - <a>Broker</a> call with `OrderQuote` including the <a>Order UUID</a>, with a `customer` object, and any `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` required, <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `OrderQuote` including any `error`s against each `OrderItem`.

- <a>Booking System</a> creates <a>Named Lease</a> for that <a>Order UUID</a> if it is supported, otherwise it provides a simple availability and `totalPaymentDue` confirmation. Works exactly as <a><b>C1</b></a>, except validates `payment` details, `customer` details, any `attendee` details, and the `orderItemIntakeFormResponse`.
- <a>Broker</a> presents the contents of the `OrderQuote` to the `Customer` to ensure they have the most up-to-date price and availability before proceeding with the purchase.
- If there are any issues with the `OrderItem`s requested in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response, with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem` - including if an `OrderItem` is no longer available, cannot be purchased in combination with another `OrderItem`, or does not contain a sufficient `orderItemIntakeFormResponse`.
- Any `error`s must be resolved by the <a>Customer</a> or <a>Broker</a> before proceeding, by amending the `OrderItem`s included in the `OrderQuote` and resubmitting until an `OrderQuote` is returned without `error`s.
- If a viable payment reconciliation route is available between the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> that requires more than just the `identifier` property of the `Payment` to be included in <a><b>B</b></a>, the `payment` property MUST be included at <a><b>C2</b></a>, as per [Payment reconciliation detail validation](#payment-reconciliation-detail-validation).
- `OrderItem`s have no `orderItemStatus`.


v) "**3. Book and Pay**" - <a>Customer</a> submits payment details and clicks Book

- The <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if no `OrderItem`s in the `OrderQuote` contain any `error`s.

- If [payment is not to be initiated](#booking-without-payment) or `totalPaymentDue` is `0`, payment details MUST NOT be captured.


vi) <dfn>Payment Authorisation</dfn> - <a>Broker</a> pre-authorises `totalPaymentDue` from <a>Payment Provider</a>

- The `Order` <a>`@id`</a>, which includes the <a>Order UUID</a>, and will be generated by the <a>Broker</a> to make the PUT call at <a><b>B</b></a> (the `Order` <a>`@id`</a> is also the PUT endpoint URL), SHOULD be used as a reference in the <a>Payment Provider</a>, if possible.

- If [payment was not initiated](#booking-without-payment) or `totalPaymentDue` is `0`, pre-authorisation MUST NOT be taken.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `Order` request with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized` at this point, even if pre-authorisation is not taken, in order to ensure that the <a>Order UUID</a> in the <a>Orders feed</a> is recognised without a race condition. Such a condition might arise in the (admittedly unlikely) event of, e.g., an `Order` that is created at <a><b>B</b></a> and then immediately cancelled by the <a>Booking System</a>, which could result in the <a>Broker</a> receiving an unrecognised `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> if it was retrieved before the call to <a><b>B</b></a> returned.


vii) <a><b>B</b></a> - <a>Broker</a> call with an `Order` including the <a>Order UUID</a>, with a `customer` object, and any `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` required, and `totalPaymentDue` including the total amount pre-authed; the <a>Booking System</a> responds with an `Order`.

- If [payment was not initiated](#booking-without-payment) or `totalPaymentDue` is `0`, the `payment` property MUST NOT be included in the `Order` request or response, and the <a>Booking System</a> MUST proceed to create a payment-free `Order`. 

- Error responses MUST be returned for any [Payment Error Conditions](#payment-error-conditions).

- The `identifier` of the `Payment` is taken from the payment pre-authorization, which must be able to be matched against any payment reports produced by the <a>Payment Provider</a> for the purposes of audit and/or reconciliation.
    
- If the `totalPaymentDue` included in the `Order` object is different to the current `totalPaymentDue` (which might have changed since <a><b>C2</b></a>, e.g. if the headline price is changed in the <a>Booking System</a> between these two steps), <a><b>B</b></a> returns an `TotalPaymentDueMismatchError` with associated status code, but the <a>Lease</a> is sustained so that the <a>Customer</a> can be prompted whether they want to continue with the new amount.

- If the <a>Lease</a> has expired, or if <a>Leases</a> are not supported, then the <a>Booking System</a> attempts to make the booking anyway. If there are insufficient spaces available for `OrderItem`s the <a><b>B</b></a> returns an `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError` with associated status code.

- If the booking succeeds only for some `OrderItem`s, the whole transaction to create the `Order` within the <a>Booking System</a> is rolled back and <a><b>B</b></a> returns an `OrderCreationFailedError` with associated status code.

- If there's a network failure, e.g. no response from server, then the <a>Broker</a> can resubmit with same <a>Order UUID</a>. As the call is idempotent, the <a>Booking System</a> will need to track the <a>Order UUID</a> supplied by <a>Broker</a> against any successfully created `Order`s, to ensure that it can return the same `Order` for subsequent requests. The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT reuse UUIDs across multiple `Order`s.

- If the call is successful (returns a 200 response), the booking is considered as complete and paid by the <a>Booking System</a> at this point.

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST reflect back all properties defined by this specification that are supplied by the <a>Broker</a>'s request in the `Order` returned from this call, including `broker` and `brokerRole`, to acknowledge they have been recognised (even if they have not actually been stored by the <a>Booking System</a>). The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT reflect back extension properties outside of this specification unless it explicitly supports them.

- The `Order` returned from this call MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a>, to be subsequently updated by the <a>Orders feed</a>. The <a>Orders feed</a> contains only partial-updates of the `Order` stored by the <a>Broker</a>, and the <a>Broker</a> is the only actor guaranteed to maintain a complete view of the `Order`. The <a>Booking System</a> MAY store the full `Order` if desired.

- It is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to store any additional state it requires that is not included in the `Order` returned from this call, and RECOMMENDED that such state is stored alongside the <a>Broker</a>'s persisted `Order`.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `Order` response in with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentDue` at this point (or `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured` if no payment is due).

- This call is idempotent, and hence if the <a>Order UUID</a> used for an `Order` already represents a completed `Order` with the same set of `OrderItem`s for the same `customer` as those specified, the success response is returned as normal. If any differences exist in the `Order`s, an <a>Order UUID</a> clash is assumed, a 500 response of with `OrderAlreadyExistsError` is returned by the <a>Booking System</a>, and a new <a>Order UUID</a> must be generated by the <a>Broker</a> to retry the call.

- As this call is idempotent, it can be safely retried in the case of an temporary unexpected error (any error that returns status code 503) or rate limiting (any error that returns status code 429).

- When the request still returns status code 503 after a number of retries the <a>Order UUID</a> MUST be regenerated to allow for a clean retry of the booking. The <a>Order UUID</a> MUST NOT be regenerated for expected errors (status code 4xx).

- `OrderItem`s returned by the <a>Booking System</a> have an `orderItemStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderItemConfirmed`.


viii) <dfn>Payment Capture</dfn> - <a>Broker</a> captures `totalPaymentDue` from <a>Payment Provider</a>

- It is the <a>Broker</a>'s responsibility to ensure that payment has been captured if required.

- If payment is required, the <a>Broker</a> MUST update its stored `Order` with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured` after payment is successfully captured.

- If [payment was not initiated](#booking-without-payment) or `totalPaymentDue` is `0`, payment MUST NOT be captured.


ix) <dfn>Invoice Generation</dfn> and <dfn>Customer Notification</dfn> - Upon successful <a>Payment Capture</a> (or completing <a><b>B</b></a> in the case of payment capture not being required), the <a>Broker</a> generates invoices, sends the <a>Customer</a> notifications, and stores the `Order` in a success state based on the response from <a><b>B</b></a>.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST update its stored `Order` in with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderDelivered` after invoices have been created and notifications successfully sent.


x) <dfn>Refunds and Cancellation</dfn> - The <a>Broker</a> subscribes to updates from the <a>Booking System</a> to process cancellations and refunds.
- A secure <a>Orders feed</a> of `Order`s MUST be provided by the <a>Booking System</a>, with the contents of the feed specific to the <a>Authentication Credentials</a>. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of <a>Booking Systems</a>, even when changes are made outside of the <a>Broker</a>. This also allows the <a>Broker</a> to handle refunds for cancellations, and process notifications to <a>Customers</a> in a consistent way.
- The <a>Booking System</a> must ensure that the `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system, for the properties included in the feed. The <a>Broker</a> MUST use these `Order`s to process refunds and send update notifications to the <a>Customer</a>.


### Booking Flow Rollback

To ensure catastrophic errors are detected and resolved the <a>Broker</a> MUST periodically check its own store for any `Order`s that have not been updated in over a 2 minutes, and have an `orderCreationStatus` other than `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete`.

Note that due to the ordering of the Booking Flow, no notifications will have been sent to the <a>Customer</a>, so no notifications regarding the rollback are required assuming it is performed promptly.

#### Booking halted at OrderCreationPaymentCaptured

If the `orderCreationStatus` is `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured`, <a>Invoice Generation</a> and <a>Customer Notification</a> should simply be retried, and the `orderCreationStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete` on success with no further rollback steps taken.

#### Booking halted at OrderCreationPaymentDue

If an error occurs during <a>Payment Capture</a>, which is very unlikely but possible due to system failure, and detectable where the `orderCreationStatus` is `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentDue`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST either:
  - Initiate manual capture via e.g. the <a>Payment Provider</a>'s admin console. Note the pre-auth will typically last for 7 days, so manual capture is still possible after the event.
  - Capture the payment from the <a>Customer</a> manually.
  - Absorb the loss and make a new payment for the same amount with the same <a>Order UUID</a> in the <a>Payment Provider</a> (better for UX / customer service, if manual capture not possible).
  - Acknowledge that payment cannot be successfully captured.

After payment has been successfully captured via one of the above methods, the `orderCreationStatus` MUST be set to `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentCaptured`, which will cause <a>Invoice Generation</a> and <a>Customer Notification</a> to be retried as per the previous section.

If the payment cannot be captured successfully:
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST issue an [Order Deletion (DELETE)](#order-deletion) request for the `Order` to remove it from the <a>Booking System</a>.
- The `orderCreationStatus` MUST be set to `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized`, to trigger the rollback step in the next section. 

#### Booking halted at OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized

If the `orderCreationStatus` is `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST:
- Cancel the associated Payment Authorisation from the <a>Payment Provider</a>.
- Soft delete the contents of the `Order` from the <a>Broker</a> (deleting any personal data, while retaining data required for audit), retaining the <a>Order UUID</a>.

Note that the <a>Order UUID</a> is retained by the <a>Broker</a> so that any related entries in the <a>Orders feed</a> can be appropriately assigned and ignored.

The <a>Order UUID</a> associated with the failed `Order` MUST NOT be reused by the <a>Broker</a> for any subsequent booking attempt.


### Contracts

A summary of the key conformance criteria for the <a>Broker</a> and <a>Booking System</a> is included here.

#### Broker contract with Booking System

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call <a><b>C1</b></a> (without <a>Customer</a> details)
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call <a><b>C2</b></a> (with <a>Customer</a> details), to retrieve the total order, providing all required details and resulting in no errors before calling <a><b>B</b></a>.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call <a><b>B</b></a> (with payment identifier if relevant), and MUST store the resulting `Order`.
- If <a><b>B</b></a> fails, the <a>Broker</a> MUST cancel the payment authorisation without any consequence to the <a>Customer</a> or <a>Seller</a>.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST process all updates to the `Order` from the <a>Orders feed</a>, specifically monitoring the <a>Orders feed</a> for cancellations.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST generate an <a>Order UUID</a>, and use it consistently during the booking flow.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT reuse <a>Order UUID</a>s across complete or incomplete `Order`s.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST make the <a>Customer</a> aware of any relevant `termsOfService`, for example by displaying a link to them prominently, before they commit to the booking.
- If `requiresExplicitConsent` is `true` for any `termsOfService` then the <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if they have explicitly acted to consent to the most recently modified version of such terms, identified by `dateModified` and the `url`.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST handle payments and reconciliation with the <a>Seller</a> and the <a>Payment Provider</a>.
- Calls to <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, and <a><b>B</b></a> MUST include the <a>`@id`</a> of the `seller` to which requested `OrderItem`s pertain, noting that it is not possible for <a>Opportunities</a> from different <a>Sellers</a> to be combined in the same `Order`.

#### Booking System contract with the Broker

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to <a><b>C1</b></a> (without <a>Customer</a> details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an indicative total order price, or a relevant error. It must also include the specification of any additional details to captured from the <a>Customer</a> to be provided to <a><b>C2</b></a>.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to <a><b>C2</b></a> (with <a>Customer</a> details) with an `OrderQuote` that includes an exact total order price, or a relevant error. It must also produce a relevant error if the additional details specified are not sufficient.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to <a><b>B</b></a> with a completed `Order`, or a relevant error. The whole booking MUST succeed or fails as one.
- Upon any cancellations or updates to the `Order` or any `OrderItem` within it, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the updated `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST store the <a>Order UUID</a> as part of the `Order` (and `OrderQuote` if leasing is enabled).
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST refuse attempts to create new orders with a previously used <a>Order UUID</a>.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST check availability and confirm pricing during <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, and <a><b>B</b></a> to ensure booking can complete.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST provide an authenticated <a>Orders feed</a> specific to the <a>Broker</a>. The contents of this feed will consist of all <a>Orders</a> updated by the Booking System.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST provide [[RPDE]] open feeds of <a>Opportunity Data</a>, including pricing and availability.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST ensure that all endpoints defined in this specification are idempotent.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the full <a>Seller</a> details in the `seller` property of the response at <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, and <a><b>B</b></a>, as such details are not included within the [opportunity data properties](#opportunity-data-properties).

With the exception of leasing, <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a> MUST NOT have any side effects.


## Booking Flow with Approval

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY optionally support review and approval of bookings by the <a>Seller</a>. As the approval processes is initiated by the <a>Booking System</a>, implementation of this section by the <a>Booking System</a> is only required if this flow is supported. Otherwise this section can be ignored.

### Customer Journey
The booking journey of a <a>Customer</a> is generalised into the following logical steps:

<figure>
 <img src="userjourneywithapproval.png" alt="High level customer journey with approval">
 <figcaption>Illustration of a typical <a>Customer</a> journey, with an approval step.</figcaption>
</figure>

The steps exactly mirror the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), with two additions in the 'Identify' step:

1. **Select**: <a>Customer</a> selects at least one <a>Opportunity</a> (e.g. `ScheduledSession` or `Slot`) and an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) £9")

2. **Identify**: <a>Customer</a> submits personal details and other requested details

<ol>

  1. **Propose**: <a>Customer</a> submits payment details, and submits a proposed booking

  2. **Approve**: <a>Seller</a> approves the booking, after a period of time

</ol>

3. **Book and Pay**: <a>Customer</a> confirms they are happy to proceed


Note that some or all steps may be skipped, or may not be presented to the <a>Customer</a>, e.g. if their registration or payment details are already known, or they are using a voice interface. These steps are not indicative of the user experience, and simply provide a common language around the flow.

### High-level API flow

<figure>
 <img src="bookingflowwithapproval.png" alt="High level booking flow with approval">
 <figcaption>Illustration of high level booking flow, including approval.</figcaption>
</figure>

The flow exactly mirrors the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), with two additions:

- The <a>Broker</a> generates an <a>Order UUID</a>, which is used to uniquely identify the `OrderQuote` / `OrderProposal` / `Order` throughout the process.

- After "**1. Select**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to confirm an indicative price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, and retrieve a total order price. Any details that the <a>Customer</a> needs to supply to complete the booking are also specified. This is checkpoint <a><b>C1</b></a> on the diagram above.

- After "**2. Identify**" the <a>Broker</a> calls the <a>Booking System</a> to reconfirm the price and availability of the selected items using an `OrderQuote`, using all details required, and retrieve a total order price. Explicit consent for any terms and conditions is also captured at this stage if required. This is checkpoint <a><b>C2</b></a> on the diagram above.

- After "**2.1. Propose**", the <a>Broker</a> first _pre-authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if required by the <a>Payment Provider</a>), then submits the proposed booking to the <a>Booking System</a> using an `OrderProposal` (<a><b>P</b></a> on the diagram above), and sends the <a>Customer</a> a notification that the proposal is under consideration. The `OrderProposal` may be negotiated between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a> via the <a>Broker</a> at this stage.

- After "**2.2. Approve**" the <a>Seller</a> approves the `OrderProposal` and the <a>Broker</a> is notified of this by the <a>Booking System</a> (<a><b>A</b></a> on the diagram above). The <a>Broker</a> can seek <a>Customer</a> permission to proceed, or simply complete the booking automatically, depending on the desired user experience.

- After "**3. Book and Pay**", if necessary the <a>Broker</a> _re-authorizes_ the payment for the total order price (if it has changed, and if required by the <a>Payment Provider</a>), then confirms the booking with <a>Booking System</a> using an `Order` (<a><b>B</b></a> on the diagram above), and finally _captures_ the payment. The <a>Broker</a> then generates invoices, and sends <a>Customer</a> notifications.

- The <a>Booking System</a> adds the `Order` to an <a>Orders feed</a> specific to the <a>Broker</a>, which the <a>Broker</a> reads to update its internal state, including those updates resulting from cancellations.

Note that the `OrderProposal` at stages 2.1 and 2.2 does not constitute a booking. The whole flow MUST be completed before the <a>Customer</a> is considered "booked" onto an <a>Opportunity</a>.

### Proposal Leasing

Leasing works as specified in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), and if a <a>Lease</a> was acquired at <a><b>C1</b></a> or <a><b>C2</b></a> it SHOULD be carried over to the `OrderProposal` and the <a>Lease</a> extended for a duration sufficient to cover the lifetime of the `OrderProposal`.

A <a>Lease</a> is NOT REQUIRED for this flow, as in some cases <a>Sellers</a> may prefer to manage contention for spaces manually via the approval process instead of leasing.

If an `OrderProposal` is in an `orderProposalStatus` other than `https://openactive.io/CustomerRejected` or `https://openactive.io/SellerRejected`, regardless of whether or not the <a>Lease</a> has expired, it MUST be possible for the <a>Customer</a> to still complete the booking if they attain approval. If at any point this is not the case, it is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> to set the `orderProposalStatus` to `https://openactive.io/SellerRejected`, or if the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of any `Offer` referenced in the `OrderProposal` request includes `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingNegotiation` within the open data, to update the `OrderProposal` to remove or replace the offending `OrderItem`(s) with an appropriate `orderSellerNote`. For example, if an <a>Opportunity</a> becomes full or is cancelled and no substitute <a>Opportunities</a> are available, then all remaining outstanding `OrderProposal`s related to that <a>Opportunity</a> would need to be automatically rejected or updated.

If the <a>Lease</a> expires the <a>Booking System</a> could, for example, automatically reject the `OrderProposal` on behalf of the `Seller`, automatically renew the <a>Lease</a>, or allow the <a>Seller</a> to manually deal with the contention for spaces as part of the approval process and hence do nothing.


### High-level type flow

<figure>
 <img src="typeflowwithapproval.png" alt="High level type flow with approval">
 <figcaption>Illustration of types used during the API flow, with approval.</figcaption>
</figure>

As specified in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), with one addition:

- **P/A** - `OrderProposal` exists in a number of states, as described in the next section, and contains enough detail to successfully create an `Order`.

### OrderProposal statuses

<figure>
 <img src="order-proposal-states.png" alt="OrderProposal states">
 <figcaption>State transition diagram showing OrderProposal states</figcaption>
</figure>

`OrderProposal` has an `orderProposalStatus` which is initially set by the <a>Booking System</a> to `https://openactive.io/AwaitingSellerConfirmation`.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST only proceed to <a><b>B</b></a> when `orderProposalStatus` is set to `https://openactive.io/SellerAccepted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

An `OrderProposal` MUST be approved or rejected atomically; partial approval is not supported in this version of the specification (though [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment) is supported).

To reach the criteria to proceed to <a><b>B</b></a>, or rejection, `OrderProposal` MUST be transitioned through states as follows:
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST transition the `OrderProposal` to a new `orderProposalStatus` by updating the <a>Orders feed</a>.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST transition the `OrderProposal` to a new `orderProposalStatus` by submitting a PATCH to the `OrderProposal` using the OrderProposal Update endpoint.

 The <a>Booking System</a> MUST generate a new <dfn>OrderProposal Version UUID</dfn>, which is a unique UUID string representation strictly as defined in [[RFC4122]], separate to the <a>Order UUID</a>, for the initial `OrderProposal`, and subsequently for each amendment made (if [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment) is supported).


#### Minimal Proposal Implementation

In the **Minimal Proposal Implementation** the `OrderProposal` can either be accepted or rejected by the <a>Seller</a>, or aborted by the <a>Customer</a>.

If an `Offer` requires this **Minimal Proposal Implementation**, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingApproval` in the `Offer`s within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support approval to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

Note that when `Offer`s that require approval are mixed with `Offer`s that do not require approval in a single `OrderQuote`, the whole `OrderQuote` MUST always require approval. It is at the discretion of the <a>Broker</a> whether to issue two separate `OrderQuote`s (and hence complete two separate booking flows) that batch those `OrderItem`s that require approval separately to those that do not, or whether to instead combine them together into a single `OrderQuote` and hence complete a single [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval).


##### Proposal Approval

- If <a>Seller</a> approval is given, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST set `orderProposalStatus` to `https://openactive.io/SellerAccepted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, which will give the <a>Broker</a> permission to proceed to <a><b>B</b></a>.
- For the [Minimal Proposal Implementation](#minimal-proposal-implementation), the <a>Broker</a> must check that the `orderProposalVersion` received in the <a>Orders feed</a> matches the original `orderProposalVersion` returned at <a><b>P</b></a>. If this is the case the <a>Broker</a> may seek <a>Customer</a> confirmation to proceed, or may simply proceed with <a><b>B</b></a> automatically, depending on the desired user experience. If this is not the case, the scenario MUST be handled via the [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment) process.

##### Proposal Rejection

- If the <a>Seller</a> rejects the proposal, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST set `orderProposalStatus` to `https://openactive.io/SellerRejected` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, optionally including an `orderSellerNote` containing any reason for rejection.
- If the <a>Customer</a> aborts the proposal, the <a>Broker</a> MUST PATCH the `OrderProposal` to set the `orderProposalStatus` to `https://openactive.io/CustomerRejected`, optionally including an `orderCustomerNote` containing any associated reason. The <a>Booking System</a> will then update this in the <a>Orders feed</a>,

Following any type of rejection, the <a>Broker</a> MUST immediately withdraw any payment authorisation.

#### Proposal Amendment

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY optionally support **Proposal Amendment**. If this is not supported by the <a>Booking System</a>, the simple Approval/Rejection workflow described in the [Minimal Proposal Implementation](#minimal-proposal-implementation) may be used without needing to consider this (as the amendments are initiated by the <a>Booking System</a>).

If an `Offer` may require **Proposal Amendment**, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingNegotiation` in the `Offer`s within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support such negotiation to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

**Proposal Amendment** allows the <a>Seller</a> to suggest amendments to the `OrderProposal` (which need to be accepted by the <a>Customer</a>) as follows:

- If the `orderProposalVersion` in the <a>Orders feed</a> has changed compared with the `orderProposalVersion` in the `OrderProposal` stored by the <a>Broker</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST notify the <a>Customer</a> that their booking requires confirmation before it can proceed. The <a>Broker</a> MUST detect and highlight any changes from their stored `OrderProposal` in the notification, based on the difference between the `OrderItem`s stored by the <a>Broker</a> and those in the feed.
- When the <a>Customer</a> confirms, the <a>Broker</a> MUST re-authorise the `totalPaymentDue`, if it has increased, with the <a>Payment Provider</a>, then proceed to <a><b>B</b></a> using the `orderProposalVersion` the <a>Customer</a> has agreed to.
- The <a>Customer</a> or <a>Seller</a> MAY also choose to abort at any point as per [Minimal Proposal Implementation](#minimal-proposal-implementation).

Note that this specification does not support `OrderProposal` amendment by the <a>Customer</a>, and that <a>Customer</a> requests for changes to an existing proposal may be done via messages communicated via [Message Exchange](#message-exchange).


#### Message Exchange

The <a>Booking System</a> and <a>Broker</a> MAY support a basic level of **Message Exchange** while the `OrderProposal` is in-flight. 

If an `Offer` requires **Message Exchange**, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingMessageExchange` in the `Offer`s within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support such negotiation to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

**Message Exchange** is achieved using the two properties `orderSellerNote` and `orderCustomerNote`, and does not have any impact on the `orderProposalVersion`.

The <a>Seller</a> MAY send a message to the <a>Customer</a> by setting `orderSellerNote` in the `OrderProposal`, and updating the `OrderProposal` in the <a>Orders feed</a>. Any change detected in the `orderSellerNote` in the <a>Orders feed</a> MUST promptly trigger a notification from the <a>Broker</a> to the <a>Customer</a>, so that the value of `orderSellerNote` can be safely overwritten with another message. To ensure that messages are not lost in the [[RPDE]] feed, the <a>Seller</a> MAY send no more than one message every 5 minutes per `OrderProposal`.

The <a>Customer</a> MAY send a message to the <a>Seller</a> by the <a>Broker</a> making a PATCH call to the OrderProposal Update endpoint to set `orderCustomerNote` in the `OrderProposal`. Any such `orderCustomerNote` updates via PATCH calls MUST either trigger a notification from the <a>Booking System</a> to the <a>Seller</a>, or be stored in the <a>Booking System</a> for later reference by the <a>Seller</a>, so that the value of `orderCustomerNote` can be safely overwritten with another message.

Note that the `orderCustomerNote` property MUST NOT be available in the <a>Orders feed</a>, to remove unnecessary [[RPDE]] updates.


### Step-by-step process description

<figure>
 <img src="sequencediagramwithapproval.png" alt="Sequence diagram with approval">
 <figcaption>Sequence diagram showing API interactions with approval</figcaption>
</figure>

For an `Order` that requires approval, the flow differs from the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), and proceeds as follows:

i-iv) The steps **1. Select**; <a><b>C1</b></a>; **2. Identify**; and <a><b>C2</b></a> of this flow are exactly the same as [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow) steps i-iv, except that `OrderQuote` is returned at <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a> with `orderRequiresApproval` set to `true` if any `OrderItem`s require approval. In this case, the next step after <a><b>C2</b></a> MUST be to follow the [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval). 

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingApproval` within its open data for any `Offer`s that require this flow. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support approval to easily filter out such offers from their experience.

- For the avoidance of doubt, as in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow):

<ul>

  - Additional data is supplied at <a><b>C2</b></a>  to satisfy the `orderItemIntakeForm` for all `OrderItem`s in <a><b>C1</b></a>.

  - The `totalPaymentDue` from <a><b>C2</b></a> is used for initial Payment Authorisation.

</ul>

v) "**2.1. Propose**" - <a>Customer</a> submits payment details, and submits an initial booking in the form of an `OrderQuote`.

- For the avoidance of doubt, as in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow):

<ul>

  - The <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if no `OrderItem`s in the `OrderQuote` contain any `error`s.

  - If [payment is not to be initiated](#booking-without-payment) or `totalPaymentDue` is `0`, payment details MUST NOT be captured.

</ul>

vi) <a><b>Payment Authorisation</b></a> - <a>Broker</a> pre-authorises `totalPaymentDue` from <a>Payment Provider</a>.
    
This proceeds almost exactly as in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), except that instead of an `Order`, an `OrderProposal` (subclassing `Order`) is created by the <a>Broker</a>.    

- As in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), the `OrderProposal` <a>`@id`</a>, which includes the <a>Order UUID</a> and is generated by the <a>Broker</a> to make the PUT call at <a><b>B</b></a> (the `OrderProposal` <a>`@id`</a> is also the PUT endpoint URL), SHOULD be used as a reference in the <a>Payment Provider</a>, if possible.

- As in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), the <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `OrderProposal` at this point even if pre-authorisation is not taken, in order to prevent the possibility of a race condition. However, note that `orderCreationStatus` MUST NOT be set on the `OrderProposal`.

vii) <a><b>P</b></a> - The <a>Broker</a> makes a request containing its newly-created `OrderProposal`, including its <a>Order UUID</a>, a `customer` object, any `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` required, and `totalPaymentDue` including the total amount pre-authed. The <a>Booking System</a> responds in turn with an `OrderProposal` with `orderProposalStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/AwaitingSellerConfirmation`.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST store this returned `OrderProposal`.

- The call MUST be atomic.

- The returned `OrderProposal` also MUST contain an `orderProposalVersion`, which is constructed from the <a>`@id`</a> of the `OrderProposal`, combined with an additional <a>OrderProposal Version UUID</a>.

- `OrderItem`s returned MUST have an `orderItemStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderItemProposed`.

- If the call is successful (returns a 200 response), the booking MUST NOT be considered as complete by the <a>Booking System</a> at this point, and instead MUST be considered in a 'proposed' state.

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT store an `orderCreationStatus` against the `OrderProposal`.

- The `OrderProposal` request MAY include an `orderCustomerNote` in order to allow the <a>Customer</a> to ask a question about this <a>Opportunity</a>, as the beginning of a [Message Exchange](#message-exchange). This is only permissible if the any `Offer` referenced in the `OrderProposal` includes an `openBookingFlowRequirement` property within the open data that contains `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingMessageExchange`.

- To match much of the behaviour of <a><b>B</b></a> in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), the following also apply:

<ul>

  - The `OrderProposal` from <a><b>P</b></a> MUST NOT be present in the <a>Orders feed</a> until it is updated at least once.

  - `totalPaymentDue` MUST be submitted to <a><b>P</b></a> and MUST match the value calculated by the <a>Booking System</a> to ensure that the `totalPaymentDue` has not changed.

  - If [payment was not initiated](#booking-without-payment) or `totalPaymentDue` is `0`, the `payment` property MUST NOT be included in the `OrderProposal` request or response. 

  - Error responses MUST be returned for any [Payment Error Conditions](#payment-error-conditions).

  - The `identifier` of the `Payment` is taken from the payment pre-authorization, which must be able to be matched against any payment reports produced by the <a>Payment Provider</a> for the purposes of audit and/or reconciliation.
  
  - If the `totalPaymentDue` included in the `Order` object is different to the current `totalPaymentDue` (which might have changed since <a><b>C2</b></a>, e.g. if the headline price is changed in the <a>Booking System</a> between these two steps), <a><b>P</b></a> returns an `TotalPaymentDueMismatchError` with associated status code, but the <a>Lease</a> is sustained so that the <a>Customer</a> can be prompted whether they want to continue with the new amount.

  - If the <a>Lease</a> has expired, or if <a>Leases</a> are not supported, then the <a>Booking System</a> attempts to create the `OrderProposal` anyway. If there are insufficient spaces available for `OrderItem`s the <a><b>P</b></a> returns an `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError` with associated status code.

  - If the booking succeeds only for some `OrderItem`s, the whole transaction to create the `OrderProposal` within the <a>Booking System</a> is rolled back and <a><b>P</b></a> returns an `OrderCreationFailedError` with associated status code.

  - If there's a network failure, e.g. no response from server, then the <a>Broker</a> can resubmit with same <a>Order UUID</a>. As the call is idempotent, the <a>Booking System</a> will need to track the <a>Order UUID</a> supplied by <a>Broker</a> against any successfully created `OrderProposal`s, to ensure that it can return the same `OrderProposal` for subsequent requests. The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT reuse UUIDs across multiple `OrderProposal`s.

  - The <a>Booking System</a> MUST reflect back all properties defined by this specification that are supplied by the <a>Broker</a>'s request in the `OrderProposal` returned from this call, including `broker` and `brokerRole`, to acknowledge they have been recognised (even if they have not actually been stored by the <a>Booking System</a>). The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT reflect back extension properties outside of this specification unless it explicitly supports them.

  - The `OrderProposal` returned from this call MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a>, to be subsequently updated by the <a>Orders feed</a>. The <a>Orders feed</a> contains only partial-updates of the `OrderProposal` stored by the <a>Broker</a>, and the <a>Broker</a> is the only actor guaranteed to maintain a complete view of the `OrderProposal`. The <a>Booking System</a> MAY store the full `OrderProposal` if desired.

  - It is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to store any additional state it requires that is not included in the `OrderProposal` returned from this call, and RECOMMENDED that such state is stored alongside the <a>Broker</a>'s persisted `Order`.

  - This call is idempotent, and hence if the <a>Order UUID</a> used for an `OrderProposal` already represents a completed `OrderProposal` with the same set of `OrderItem`s for the same `customer` as those specified, the success response is returned as normal. If any differences exist in the `OrderProposal`s, a <a>Order UUID</a> clash is assumed, a 500 response of with `OrderAlreadyExistsError` is returned by the <a>Booking System</a>, and a new <a>Order UUID</a> must be generated by the <a>Broker</a> to retry the call.

  - As this call is idempotent, it can be safely retried in the case of an temporary unexpected error (any error that returns status code 503) or rate limiting (any error that returns status code 429).

  - When the request still returns status code 503 after a number of retries the <a>Order UUID</a> MUST be regenerated to allow for a clean retry of the booking. The <a>Order UUID</a> MUST NOT be regenerated for expected errors (status code 4xx).

</ul>

viii) "**2.2. Approve**" -  <a>Seller</a> approves the booking after automated or manual review.

- The <a>Booking System</a> must ensure that the `OrderProposal`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> represent the current state of `OrderProposal` within the system. The <a>Broker</a> MUST use these `OrderProposal`s to process `orderProposalStatus` changes and send update notifications to the <a>Customer</a>, including any new values for `orderSellerNote`.

- Once approved, the <a>Booking System</a> puts the updated `OrderProposal` onto the <a>Orders feed</a> (<dfn><b>A</b></dfn>), with either an unchanged `orderProposalVersion` (see [Minimal Proposal Implementation](#minimal-proposal-implementation)) or a new `orderProposalVersion` (see [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment)).

- If the `orderProposalVersion` in the <a>Orders feed</a> has changed compared with the `orderProposalVersion` in the `OrderProposal` stored by the <a>Broker</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST notify the <a>Customer</a> that their booking requires confirmation before it can proceed. The <a>Broker</a> MUST detect and highlight any changes from their stored `OrderProposal` in the notification, based on the difference between the `OrderItem`s stored by the <a>Broker</a> and those in the feed.


ix) "**3. Book and Pay**" - <a>Customer</a> confirms booking

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST only proceed when `orderProposalStatus` is set to `https://openactive.io/SellerAccepted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and the `orderProposalVersion` is set to a value the <a>Customer</a> has agreed to (see [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment)).

- If in the revised `OrderProposal`, [payment initiation is now optional](#booking-without-payment), the <a>Customer</a> MAY be given the option to prepay or simply reserve a space without payment. Providing optionality of payment to the <a>Customer</a> is at the <a>Broker</a>'s discretion.

- If payment details were not previously captured and [payment is now to be initiated](#booking-without-payment), due to the revised `OrderProposal`, they MUST be captured. If `totalPaymentDue` is `0`, payment details MUST NOT be captured.


x) <dfn>Payment Re-authorisation</dfn> - <a>Broker</a> re-authorises `totalPaymentDue` from <a>Payment Provider</a> as necessary

- If [payment is still appropriate](#booking-without-payment) given the latest `orderProposalVersion` that the <a>Customer</a> has agreed to (see [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment)), and if `totalPaymentDue` has increased or if the previous Payment Authorisation has expired, the <a>Broker</a> MUST re-authorise the total amount with the <a>Payment Provider</a>.

- As with the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), the <a>Broker</a> MUST store the `Order` request with an `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationPaymentAuthorized` at this point, even if pre-authorisation is not taken, in order to ensure that the <a>Order UUID</a> in the <a>Orders feed</a> is recognised without a race condition.


xi) <a><b>B</b></a> - The <a>Broker</a> makes a minimal call with an `Order` consisting of only the `orderProposalVersion` and any additional `payment` data from the re-authorisation step if necessary; the <a>Booking System</a> responds with a full `Order` as per the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow).

- If the <a>Lease</a> has expired, or if <a>Leases</a> are not supported, then the <a>Booking System</a> attempts to make the booking anyway. If there are insufficient spaces available for `OrderItem`s then <a><b>B</b></a> returns an `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError` with associated status code and the original `OrderProposal` MUST be rejected by the <a>Seller</a> as per [Proposal Leasing](#proposal-leasing). Note that this is unlikely to occur as in such cases the `OrderProposal` SHOULD have already been rejected when it could no longer be fulfilled.

- If a newer version of the `OrderProposal` is available compared with the `orderProposalVersion` provided by the <a>Broker</a>, then <a><b>B</b></a> MUST return an `OrderProposalVersionOutdatedError` with associated status code.

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST reflect back all properties defined by this specification that were supplied in the <a>Broker</a>'s original `OrderProposal` request (with amendments if [Proposal Amendment](#proposal-amendment) has occurred), to acknowledge they have been recognised. The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT reflect back extension properties outside of this specification unless it explicitly supports them. The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT reflect back the `orderProposalVersion` in its response to <a><b>B</b></a>.
    
- All other behaviour is identical to the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow) step vii. The <a>Broker</a> stores the response to <a><b>B</b></a> to completely replace their previously stored `OrderProposal`, and the previous `OrderProposal` is set to `"state": "deleted"` in the <a>Orders feed</a>. The `orderProposalVersion` MUST NOT be included in the new `Order`.

xii-xiv) The <a>Payment Capture</a>, <a>Invoice Generation</a>, <a>Customer Notification</a>, and <a>Refunds and Cancellation</a> steps of this flow are exactly the same as [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow) steps viii-x.


[Booking Flow Rollback](#booking-flow-rollback) also applies to this flow exactly as in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow).



### Contract

A summary of the key conformance criteria is included here. These apply for the [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval) _in addition to_ the contract specified in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow).

#### Broker contract with Booking System

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST call <a><b>P</b></a> with <a>Customer</a> details as they would for <a><b>B</b></a> in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), and MUST store the resulting `OrderProposal`.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST process updates to the `OrderProposal` from the <a>Orders feed</a>, including <a><b>A</b></a>.
- The <a>Broker</a> MAY negotiate on the `OrderProposal` using a OrderProposal Update call.
- Calls to <a><b>P</b></a> MUST include the <a>`@id`</a> of the `seller` to which requested `OrderItem`s pertain.


#### Booking System contract with the Broker

- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond to <a><b>P</b></a> with an `OrderProposal`, or a relevant error. The whole creation of the `OrderProposal` MUST succeed or fails as one.
- Upon approval or updates to the `OrderProposal` or any `OrderItem` within it, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the updated `OrderProposal` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, including <a><b>A</b></a>.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MAY negotiate on the `OrderProposal` using the <a>Orders feed</a>.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the full <a>Seller</a> details in the `seller` property of the response at <a><b>P</b></a>.


## Customer Details and Additional Details capture

### Customer Details capture

The specification includes provision to capture of the following details related to the <a>Customer</a> (the actor who is booking), with only the e-mail address being required.
- E-mail address (`email`)
- Forename (`givenName`)
- Surname (`familyName`)
- Telephone (`telephone`)

Note that these are _not_ the details of attendees, and that the <a>Customer</a> is not guaranteed to participate in the activity. This facilitates child booking as the <a>Customer</a> can easily book on behalf of a child, without supplying the child's own personal details.

### Attendee Details capture

If attendee details in scope of the `Person` type are captured, they MUST be captured via the `attendee` property of the `OrderItem` (and not using the `orderItemIntakeForm`). This allows attendee details to be stored and reused by the <a>Broker</a>.

If the same `attendee` is used across multiple `OrderItem`s, a duplicate `Person` MUST be provided for each of these `OrderItem`s. The <a>Broker</a> may choose to design their user interface to minimise repeat data entry (e.g. by allowing the <a>Customer</a> to enter attendee details first, then later assigning them to `OrderItem`s), however this is outside the scope of the specification.

Note that conformance with this specification requires that the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT _require_ attendee data to be submitted in all cases, and that configuration of which attendee details are required (if any) MUST be available to the <a>Seller</a>.

If an `Offer` requires attendee details capture, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingAttendeeDetails` in the `Offer` within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support attendee details capture to easily filter out such `Offer`s from their experience.

<pre class="example" title="Example of attendeeDetailsRequired provided by Booking System at C1">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "attendeeDetailsRequired": [
      "https://schema.org/givenName",
      "https://schema.org/familyName"
    ],
  }
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Example of attendee details provided with each OrderItem at C2">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "attendee": {
      "@type": "Person",
      "email": "geoffcapes@example.com",
      "telephone": "020 811 8055",
      "givenName": "Geoff",
      "familyName": "Capes"
    }
  }
</pre>

If a required property within `Person` is not supplied by the <a>Broker</a> the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include an `IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError` against the offending `OrderItem` at <a><b>C2</b></a> which includes an `instance` that references the <a>`@id`</a> of the missing or invalid `Property`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of an error for missing attendee property data">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "error": [
      {
        "@type": "IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError",
        "instance": "https://schema.org/givenName",
        "description": "Missing attendee first name"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

The <a>Broker</a> MAY remember the attendee data previously submitted by the <a>Customer</a>, if consent is provided.


### Additional Details capture

This version of the specification does not provide comprehensive support for construction of a complex additional details capture form. However, it does facilitate the use of simple text fields, dropdowns and checkboxes to capture additional details. These can be used for both the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow) and the [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval).

If an `Offer` requires additional details capture, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingIntakeForm` in the `Offer` within its open data. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support such additional details capture to easily filter out such `Offer`s from their experience.

Four types of form element are available, all of which sub-class `PropertyValueSpecification`:
- `ShortAnswerFormFieldSpecification`
- `ParagraphFormFieldSpecification`
- `DropdownFormFieldSpecification`
- `BooleanFormFieldSpecification`

#### Text fields

`ShortAnswerFormFieldSpecification` and `ParagraphFormFieldSpecification` are identical except that they represent a single-line text box and a multi-line text box, respectively.

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeForm with ShortAnswerFormSpecification provided by Booking System at C1">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeForm": [
      {
        "@type": "ShortAnswerFormSpecification",
        "@id": "https://example.com/experience",
        "name": "Level of experience",
        "description": "Have you played before? Are you a complete beginner or seasoned pro?",
        "valueRequired": true
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeFormResponse for ShortAnswerFormSpecification provided by Broker at C2">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeFormResponse": [
      {
        "@type": "PropertyValue",
        "propertyID": "https://example.com/experience",
        "value": "I've played twice before, but I'm a quick learner so I hope to keep up!"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>


#### Dropdown fields

`DropdownFormFieldSpecification` provides a list of options in a dropdown format.

`valueOption`s are provided as an array of simple strings containing display values, and are supplied back to the <a>Booking System</a> using these display values in the `orderItemIntakeFormResponse`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeForm with DropdownFormFieldSpecification provided by Booking System at C1">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeForm": [
      {
        "@type": "DropdownFormFieldSpecification",
        "@id": "https://example.com/age",
        "name": "Age",
        "description": "Your age is useful for us to place you in the correct group on the day",
        "valueOption": ["0-18", "18-30", "30+"],
        "valueRequired": true
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeFormResponse for DropdownFormFieldSpecification provided by Broker at C2">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeFormResponse": [
      {
        "@type": "PropertyValue",
        "propertyID": "https://example.com/age",
        "value": "0-18"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>


#### Checkbox fields

`BooleanFormFieldSpecification` accepts either a `true` or `false` response, and MUST NOT be specified as `valueRequired`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeForm with BooleanFormFieldSpecification provided by Booking System at C1">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeForm": [
      {
        "@type": "BooleanFormFieldSpecification",
        "@id": "https://example.com/photoconsent",
        "name": "Photo Consent",
        "description": "Are you happy for us to include photos of you in our marketing materials?"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

The `value` in the `PropertyValue` response MUST be either `true` or `false`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of orderItemIntakeFormResponse for BooleanFormFieldSpecification provided by Broker at C2">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "orderItemIntakeFormResponse": [
      {
        "@type": "PropertyValue",
        "propertyID": "https://example.com/photoconsent",
        "value": true
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>


#### Form validation and auto-fill

If a field with `valueRequired` is not supplied by the <a>Broker</a>, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include an `IncompleteIntakeFormError` against the offending `OrderItem` at <a><b>C2</b></a> which includes an `instance` that references the <a>`@id`</a> of the specific `PropertyValueSpecification`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of an error for missing additional details field data">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "error": [
      {
        "@type": "IncompleteIntakeFormError",
        "instance": "https://example.com/experience",
        "description": "Incomplete additional details supplied"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

If the contents of a field supplied by the <a>Broker</a> are present but invalid, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST include an `InvalidIntakeFormError` against the offending `OrderItem` at <a><b>C2</b></a> which includes both an `instance` that references the <a>`@id`</a> of the specific `PropertyValueSpecification`, and a human-readable `description` of the validation constraint to allow the <a>Customer</a> to correct it.

In this version of the specification, any field value validation MUST be implemented by the <a>Booking System</a> via `InvalidIntakeFormError`, for example if integer values are required.

<pre class="example" title="Example of an error for invalid additional details field data">
  {
    "@type": "OrderItem",
    ...
    "error": [
      {
        "@type": "InvalidIntakeFormError",
        "instance": "https://example.com/shoesize",
        "description": "The provided shoe size is not a number"
      }
    ]
  }
</pre>

The <a>Broker</a> MAY remember the values previously submitted by the <a>Customer</a> based on the <a>`@id`</a> of the `PropertyValueSpecification`, if consent for such storage is provided.

It is expected that future versions of the specification will support more complex field types.

# Broker Roles

A <a>Broker</a> is an actor that arranges transactions between a <a>Seller</a> and <a>Customer</a>, either directly or indirectly.

From a contractual and taxation perspective, there are two types of <a>Broker</a>: agents (`AgentBroker`), and resellers (`ResellerBroker`). In addition, situations in which the <a>customer</a> contracts directly with the <a>seller</a> without a third party are represented by the `brokerRole` value of `NoBroker`.

Note that this specification does not deal with contractual relationships, and simply provides a mechanism to record bookings.

## `ResellerBroker`

### Definition
A reseller is a company or individual that purchases goods or services with the intention of selling them rather than consuming or using them. This is usually done for profit (but could be resold at a loss).

### Contractual Relationships
In the context of OpenActive, a `ResellerBroker` contracts directly with the <a>Seller</a> as a business-to-business relationship to purchase access to the <a>Opportunity</a>. It then, at a later point in time (which may only be milliseconds later), separately forms a contractual relationship with the <a>Customer</a>, who purchases access to the <a>Opportunity</a> from the `ResellerBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="ResellerBroker.png" alt="ResellerBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in ResellerBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>


### Taxation
The `ResellerBroker`'s purchase from the <a>Seller</a> is business-to-business, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the <a>Customer</a>.
The <a>Customer</a>'s purchase from the `ResellerBroker` is business-to-consumer, which is subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `ResellerBroker` as the <a>Seller</a>.

Hence any tax exemption that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. in UK law, if the <a>Seller</a> is a [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is not relevant here, as no direct contractual relationship is formed between <a>Seller</a> and <a>Customer</a>.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and <a>Seller</a>. It does not include provision for the interaction between the `ResellerBroker` and <a>Customer</a> explicitly, though it may be repurposed by the <a>Broker</a> to perform this function by treating the <a>Broker</a> as a <a>Booking System</a>. This specification also does not include provision for the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship with any <a>Payment Provider</a> (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.
When the `brokerRole` is set to `ResellerBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `broker` specified in the `Order`.
Note that the `customer` may still optionally be included in the Order, for example to help front-of-house staff identify the <a>Customer</a>.

### Conformance criteria
When the <a>Broker</a> generates the <a>Invoice</a>, it must be made payable to `Order.broker`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` is optional.


## `AgentBroker`

### Definition
An agent is authorized to act on behalf of another (the <a>Seller</a>, or "principal") to create legal relations with a third party (the <a>Customer</a>). Succinctly, it may be referred to as the equal relationship between a <a>Seller</a> and an agent whereby the principal, expressly or implicitly, authorizes the agent to work under his or her control and on his or her behalf. The agent is required to negotiate on behalf of the principal (<a>Seller</a>) and/or bring them and third parties (<a>Customers</a>) into contractual relationship.

### Contractual Relationships
There are three separate types of contractual relationship involved:
`AgentBroker` with <a>Seller</a>, known as the principal-agent relationship or "internal" relationship;
`AgentBroker` with <a>Customer</a> with whom they deal on their <a>Seller</a>'s behalf ("external relationship"); and
<a>Seller</a> with <a>Customer</a> when arranged by an `AgentBroker`.

<figure>
 <img src="AgentBroker.png" alt="AgentBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in AgentBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
While facilitated by the `AgentBroker`, the primary purchase is made by the <a>Customer</a> directly from the <a>Seller</a>, as would be the case if the <a>Customer</a> was to purchase from the <a>Seller</a> independently.
Hence any tax exemption that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. in UK law, if the <a>Seller</a> is an [VAT exempt eligible body](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sport-supplies-that-are-vat-exempt-notice-70145)) is relevant here.

The <a>Customer</a>'s relationship with `AgentBroker` is business-to-consumer. Hence any additional services (e.g. customer-facing booking fees) are subject to the appropriate taxation based on the `AgentBroker` as the `seller`.

The `AgentBroker`'s relationship with the <a>Seller</a> is business-to-business. Hence any additional services (e.g. booking commission) are subject to the appropriate taxation.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a>.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship between the `AgentBroker` and the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. for booking commission), between the `AgentBroker` and the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. for booking fees) or with any <a>Payment Provider</a> (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships and the reconciliation of associated invoices MUST be handled separately.
When the `brokerRole` is set to `AgentBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the `Order`.

### Conformance criteria
When the <a>Broker</a> generates the <a>Invoice</a>, it must be made payable to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

### Informed purchase
When using a `brokerRole` of `AgentBroker`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST make the <a>Customer</a> aware that they are purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> via the <a>Broker</a>, and not directly from the <a>Broker</a>.

## `NoBroker`

### Definition
This specification supports direct purchase by a <a>Customer</a> (for example in the context of the <a>Seller</a>'s own website, or for businesses that purchase large volumes of FacilityUse slots to run leagues).

### Contractual Relationships
The contractual relationship is a simple one between the <a>Seller</a> and the <a>Customer</a>.

<figure>
 <img src="NoBroker.png" alt="NoBroker relationships">
 <figcaption>Contractual relationships in NoBroker mode</figcaption>
</figure>

### Taxation
The purchase is made by the <a>Customer</a> directly from the <a>Seller</a>, as would be the case if the <a>Customer</a> was to purchase from the <a>Seller</a> outside of this specification.
Hence any tax exemption that the <a>Customer</a> may enjoy when purchasing directly from the <a>Seller</a> (e.g. in UK law, if the <a>Seller</a> is an VAT exempt eligible body) is relevant here.

### Scope of Specification
This specification is designed to govern the recording of the execution of the contractual relationship between the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a>.
The scope of this specification does not include the contractual relationship with any <a>Payment Provider</a> (e.g. for payment processing fees). Such relationships MUST be handled separately.

When the `brokerRole` is set to `NoBroker`, this indicates that the payee for accounting and tax purposes is the `customer` specified in the `Order`.

### Conformance criteria
When an <a>Invoice</a> is generated, it must be made payable to `Order.customer`, `Order.broker` MUST NOT be provided and `Order.customer` MUST be provided.

# Systems of Record


## Roles and responsibilities overview


For the purposes of this specification, the key components of a booking are: `Order`, <a>Invoice</a>, <a>Payment</a> and <a>Refund</a>.

Note that `OrderQuote` is a subclass of `Order` used during the `Order` creation process, and is not explicitly persisted.

The <a>Broker</a> has visibility of all components, while for simplicity of implementation the <a>Booking System</a> only has visibility of the `Order`, as shown below:

<figure>
 <img src="roles.png" alt="Roles and responsibilities">
 <figcaption>Roles and responsibilities</figcaption>
</figure>

`Order`s are the basis of the exchange between the <a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Broker</a>, with `OrderQuote`s used as part of the `Order` creation process. This specification describes a detailed model and API to allow <a>Brokers</a> to manipulate `Order`s, and only high level functional requirements for the expected behaviour of <a>Invoices</a>, <a>Payments</a>, and <a>Refunds</a>.


| Component | Description | Owner | Audit |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| <dfn>`Order`</dfn> | A mutable object that encompasses the live state of the bookable `Event`s within the <a>Booking System</a>. An `Order` has a `orderItem`s, a `totalPaymentDue`, and all tax details, but is not itself a legal representation of a purchase from the <a>Seller</a>. | <a>Booking System</a>. | Mutable |
| <dfn>Invoice</dfn> | An immutable object that is a legal representation of the purchase, which MUST be rendered to the <a>Customer</a> as a legally permissible tax receipt, and exist as a tax point. A new <a>Invoice</a> MUST be generated for the `Order` to replace the previous <a>Invoice</a> on each occasion that a set of `orderItem`s within an `Order` are cancelled. | <a>Broker</a> | Immutable |
| <dfn>Payment</dfn> | A immutable object that represents the original payment to the <a>Seller</a> for the initial `Order`. Although modelling the <a>Payment</a> is outside the scope of this specification, it is recommended that one payment exists for each `Order`. | <a>Payment Provider</a> | Immutable |
| <dfn>Refund</dfn> | An immutable object that represents each refund made against the <a>Payment</a>, up to the <a>Payment</a>'s total amount | <a>Payment Provider</a> | Immutable |


## Invoices and Tax receipts

Due to the variety of business models in use in OpenActive, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT send receipts directly to the <a>Customer</a> for `AgentBroker` and `ResellerBroker` bookings.

For each successful booking operation, the <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a new <a>Invoice</a> in the form of a tax receipt, on the basis of the response from <a><b>B</b></a>. To ensure that the <a>Customer</a> is provided with the correct tax receipt, if `totalPaymentTax` is provided in an `Order` from <a><b>B</b></a> or subsequently in the <a>Orders feed</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a new or updated <a>Invoice</a> and either (a) send a tax receipt representation of the <a>Invoice</a> to the <a>Customer</a> and/or (b) offer a means to allow the <a>Customer</a> to easily retrieve a full tax receipt representation of the specific version of the  <a>Invoice</a> at any future date for any previous booking made. As it is ultimately the <a>Seller</a>'s responsibility to send tax receipts, they need to be confident that the <a>Broker</a> is making tax information available to its <a>Customers</a> in an accurate and timely manner.

The tax receipt sent by the <a>Broker</a> MUST comply with any legal requirements of the jurisdiction of operation.

Note that if the specification is followed correctly, for all <a>Broker</a> modes where a <a>Seller</a> may need to supply a tax receipt manually for any reason, the <a>Seller</a> will have sufficient details of the <a>Customer</a> and of the transaction to generate the most recent tax receipt.


## Payments and Refunds

Due to the variety of business models available in the OpenActive ecosystem, conformance to this specification requires that the <a>Payment Provider</a> be distinct from the <a>Booking System</a> for which this API is defined. The <a>Booking System</a> MAY separately expose its own native payment functionality as if it were a <a>Payment Provider</a>, however its use MUST be OPTIONAL.

Although the details of <a>Payments</a> and <a>Refunds</a> are not in the scope of this specification, a single `Payment` object is included in the `Order` in the `payment` property to ensure payments are fully traceable in case of audit.


### Virtual payments

Note that this `Payment` is permitted to represent a virtual <a>Payment</a> consolidating a number of actual **Payments** to allow for a wide variety of payment methods. In the case where the <a>Seller</a> is paid monthly, the <a>Payment</a> may refer to a future invoice against which the <a>Payment</a> will eventually be paid. 

### Basic `Payment`

A unique reference to this <a>Payment</a> MUST be included in the `Payment` `identifier` of the `Order` sent to the <a>Booking System</a>. This `Payment` `identifier` MUST be uniquely resolvable for audit purposes.

The `accountId` of the `Payment` SHOULD be provided to reference the specific account within the <a>Payment Provider</a> that is used for reconciliation purposes.

The `paymentProviderId` of the `Payment` SHOULD be provided to reference the specific <a>Payment Provider</a> that is used.

The `name` of the `Payment` SHOULD be used to provide information about the source of the payment that can be stored in the <a>Booking System</a>, to help the <a>Seller</a> in discussions with the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. "AcmeBroker Points" or "AcmeBroker via Credit Card").

<pre class="example" title="Example of Payment">
  "payment": {
    "@type": "Payment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "name": "Big Media Services",
    "accountId": "SN1593",
    "paymentProviderId": "STRIPE"
  },
</pre>

#### Payment reconciliation detail validation

Payment reconciliation detail validation is required if any viable payment reconciliation route exists between the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> that necessitates more than just the `identifier` property of the `Payment` being included in <a><b>B</b></a>. For simplicity of implementation, such validation is required even if the `totalPaymentDue` is likely to be `0` or the `prepayment` value of the selected `Offer`s indicates no payment.

This ensures that a viable payment reconciliation route is available before the <a>Customer</a> starts to enter their data.

To achieve such validation, the `payment` property MUST be included at <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a> by the <a>Broker</a> in the `OrderQuote` request, including all relevant properties of `Payment` except the `identifier`.

If the `payment` details supplied (e.g. `accountId`) are not considered valid for reconciliation by the <a>Booking System</a> then a `InvalidPaymentDetailsError` MUST be returned at <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a>.

For the <a>Booking System</a>, the `payment` property at <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a> is always considered optional, as a payment reconciliation route may not exist.

At <a><b>B</b></a> and <a><b>P</b></a> the `payment` property MUST only be included if a payment is actually being processed. If payment details were not captured due to the `prepayment` value of the selected `Offer`, or if `totalPaymentDue` is `0` due to all `OrderItem`s being free of charge, the `payment` property MUST NOT be included in the `Order` at <a><b>B</b></a>. In all other cases `payment` property MUST be included in the `Order` at <a><b>B</b></a>.

For the simple case, if the <a>Booking System</a> does not implement properties other than the `identifier` property of the `Payment`, the `Payment` MUST simply be reflected back in the response to <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, <a><b>B</b></a> and <a><b>P</b></a> with only the `identifier` property included, and no implementation of the `InvalidPaymentDetailsError` response is required.


### `DynamicPayment`

For fully dynamic pricing, where price is not known at the point of purchase, a `DynamicPayment` MUST be used. Example use cases include volume-based pricing, where the price of items are calculated at the end of the month depending on the total volume booked during that period.

To use the `DynamicPayment` the following preconditions must be met:
- The <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> MUST have agreed an arrangement for dynamic pricing out-of-band, including which <a>Opportunities</a> and `Offer`s it applies to.
- Dynamic pricing cannot be mixed with standard pricing behaviour within the same `Order`, so all `OrderItem`s selected MUST be applicable for dynamic pricing based on such agreements.
- The <a>Opportunities</a> that are selected for booking MUST be <a>bookable</a> as in the standard flow.

To use `DynamicPayment` the booking flow MUST be completed as normal with the following additional requirements:
- The `OrderQuote`, `OrderProposal` and `Order` in request, response, and in the subsequent <a>Orders feed</a> MUST NOT include `totalPaymentDue` or `totalPaymentTax`, and `OrderItem`s MUST NOT include `acceptedOffer` or `unitTaxSpecification`.
- The booking flow MUST be completed _as if_ `prepayment` was set to `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` for the `acceptedOffer` for all `OrderItem`s.
- The `OrderQuote` / `OrderProposal` / `Order` submitted to <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a> and <a><b>B</b></a> (and <a><b>P</b></a> if using approval) MUST have a `payment` property that contains a `DynamicPayment`, which is consistent throughout the calls.
- If the `DynamicPayment` details supplied (e.g. `accountId`) are not considered either sufficient or [valid for reconciliation](#payment-reconciliation-detail-validation) by the <a>Booking System</a> then either `IncompletePaymentDetailsError` or `InvalidPaymentDetailsError` MUST be returned by all calls, respectively.
- The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT record any price against the `Order` or `OrderItem`s for reconciliation, as such reconciliation MUST occur completely out-of-band.

The `accountId` of the `DynamicPayment` MUST be used consistently in order to allow the <a>Seller</a> to reconcile <a>Opportunities</a> booked using a particular account.

The `name` of the `DynamicPayment` SHOULD be used to provide information about the source of the payment that can be stored in the <a>Booking System</a>,  to help the <a>Seller</a> in discussions with the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. "AcmeBroker Points" or "AcmeBroker Membership").

Note that the <a>Booking System</a> MAY choose to validate the `DynamicPayment` details, as above, though this is not a requirement - it could simply accept any values provided.

<pre class="example" title="Example of DynamicPayment">
  "payment": {
    "@type": "DynamicPayment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "name": "MoveGB Membership",
    "accountId": "MOVE"
  },
</pre>

### Payment reconciliation identifiers

Although automated payment reconciliation is outside the current scope of this specification, a <a>Booking System</a> MAY include identifiers suitable for payment reconciliation to be handled out-of-band with each `OrderItem` using the `additionalProperty` property.

In keeping with the Schema.org definition of `PropertyValue`, the `name` and `value` properties MUST be provided within any given `PropertyValue`, and the <a>Broker</a> SHOULD include these in any reconciliation process with the <a>Seller</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Example of additionalProperty for OrderItem">
  "additionalProperty": [
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "SiteID",
      "value": "ABC1234"
    },
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "DeptID",
      "value": "D89"
    }
  ],
</pre>


## Tax calculation

### Business-to-consumer tax calculation by Booking System is mandatory

For `AgentBroker` and `NoBroker` modes, where the <a>Customer</a> is of type `Person` and a tax receipt is usually generated by the <a>Booking System</a>, the tax calculation and associated properties this specification MUST be implemented by the <a>Booking System</a> (even if the resulting tax amount is zero).

### Business-to-business tax calculation by Booking System is optional

Tax calculation at the <a>Booking System</a> is OPTIONAL when the `brokerRole` of `ResellerBroker` is specified, or when a <a>Customer</a> of type `Organization` is specified. If tax calculation is not supported for a `ResellerBroker`, `unitTaxSpecification` and `totalPaymentTax` MUST NOT be included, and the `taxCalculationExcluded` property MUST be returned as `true` in the `OrderQuote` and `Order` (i.e. explicitly not including tax).

When `taxCalculationExcluded` is `true`, all `Offer`s MUST include net `price`s (i.e. without tax included), regardless of the `taxMode`. This allows tax to be calculated by the `ResellerBroker` or business <a>Customer</a> and reconciled outside of this specification.

Note that for business-to-business sales for a <a>Seller</a> with `taxMode` of the `organizer` or `provider` set to `https://openactive.io/TaxGross`, the `Offer`s available in the <a>Opportunity Data</a> will still be calculated as tax-inclusive for a business-to-consumer sale, and so MUST be presented by the <a>Broker</a> as such, with the business-to-business tax calculation occurring during the booking flow. If the usecase of presenting the correct price up-front gains traction, additional price data must be made available as part of the openly published <a>Opportunity Data</a> to resolve this shortcoming.

## Tax mode

The `taxMode` (`https://openactive.io/TaxNet` or `https://openactive.io/TaxGross`) is REQUIRED to be specified at the <a>Seller</a> level. It MUST be reflected within the `Organization` or `Person` that is included in the REQUIRED `organizer` or `provider` properties within <a>Opportunity Data</a> specified in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]], and within the REQUIRED `seller` property in the responses from <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, <a><b>P</b></a> and <a><b>B</b></a>. It MUST also be consistent for all `Order`s originating from that <a>Seller</a>.

Note that `taxMode` only affects the interpretation of the `price` of the `Offer`. `totalPaymentDue` is always Gross (tax inclusive), and `unitTaxSpecification` and `totalPaymentTax` include only the taxes themselves so are unaffected.

| `taxMode`                                              | `https://openactive.io/TaxNet` | `https://openactive.io/TaxGross` |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Price displayed                                        | Excludes tax                | Includes all applicable taxes assuming a `Person` as a `customer` |
| Currencies usually associated                          | USD, CAD                    | EUR, AUD, GBP                 |
| Example price of <a>Opportunity</a> before tax                | 10.00                       | 10.00                         |
| Example tax rate                                       | 0.2                         | 0.2                           |
| Price displayed to <a>Customer</a> during browsing (`Offer`)  | 10.00                       | 12.00                         |
| Total paid by <a>Customer</a> (`totalPaymentDue`)             | 12.00                       | 12.00                         |


## Booking without payment

If the OPTIONAL `prepayment` feature of this specification is supported by the <a>Booking System</a>, the following logic MUST be applied by the <a>Booking System</a> to populate the `prepayment` value of `totalPaymentDue` in the `OrderQuote` response of <a><b>C1</b></a> or <a><b>C2</b></a>:

| `acceptedOffer`s across `OrderItem`s  |  <a>Booking System</a> sets `prepayment` value of `totalPaymentDue`        |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| _Any_ `prepayment` values are either `https://openactive.io/Required` or omitted where `price` values are also not `0` | `https://openactive.io/Required`  |
| _At least one_ `prepayment` value is `https://openactive.io/Optional` and the rest are either `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` or omitted where `price` values are also `0` |  `https://openactive.io/Optional` |
| _In all cases_ either `prepayment` value is `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` or `price` value is `0` | `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` |

If the `prepayment` property is not supported by the <a>Booking System</a>, the `prepayment` property MUST simply be omitted in all cases, however the <a>Booking System</a> MUST still handle the [payment error conditions](#payment-error-conditions).

The following logic MUST be applied by the <a>Broker</a> to determine whether to initiate taking payment from the <a>Customer</a>, and applies whether or not the <a>Booking System</a> supports `prepayment`:

| `totalPaymentDue`        | <a>Broker</a> initiates payment  |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `prepayment` is `https://openactive.io/Required`, or omitted and `price` is not `0` | Always |
| `prepayment` is `https://openactive.io/Optional`  | The <a>Customer</a> MAY be given the option, at the <a>Broker</a>'s discretion |
| `prepayment` is `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` or `price` is `0` | Never |

If payment is not to be initiated based on the above:

- The <a>Broker</a> MUST communicate to the <a>Customer</a> that they are simply reserving a space without payment.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT accept payment details, attempt payment pre-authorisation, or attempt payment capture.
- The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT include the `payment` property in the request to <a><b>B</b></a> or <a><b>P</b></a>.
- The <a>Booking System</a> therefore MUST NOT include the `payment` property in the response from <a><b>B</b></a> or <a><b>P</b></a>, and MUST proceed to create a payment-free `Order` or `OrderProposal`.

### Free opportunities

<dfn>Free Opportunities</dfn>, defined as those with at least one applicable `Offer` with a `price` of `0`, MUST follow the same workflow as paid <a>Opportunities</a>.

For `Offer`s with a `price` of `0`:
- The `prepayment` property of the `Offer` MUST be either `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` or unspecified.
- The `Offer` MAY not include `priceCurrency`.
- If a `priceCurrency` is not available then <a>Brokers</a> SHOULD communicate "Free" or equivalent when referencing a zero price.

When an `Order` or `OrderProposal` involves exclusively <a>Free Opportunities</a> the `totalPaymentDue` will be `0` regardless of the `prepayment` property values. In this case, no interaction with a <a>Payment Provider</a> is required, the `payment` property MAY be omitted at <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a> (depending on [Payment Reconciliation Detail Validation](#payment-reconciliation-detail-validation)), and MUST be omitted at <a><b>B</b></a> or <a><b>P</b></a>.

### Payment error conditions

At <a><b>B</b></a> or <a><b>P</b></a> the <a>Booking System</a> MUST produce an error response in the following cases:
- If the `payment` property is expected in the request (as within `totalPaymentDue`: `prepayment` is `https://openactive.io/Required`, or if `prepayment` not supported, `price` is not `0`) but not provided, then a `MissingPaymentDetailsError` MUST be returned .
- If the `payment` property is provided but not expected in the request (as within `totalPaymentDue`: `prepayment` is `https://openactive.io/Unavailable` or `price` is `0`), then an `UnnecessaryPaymentDetailsError` MUST be returned.
- If the `payment` property does not include `identifier`, then an `IncompletePaymentDetailsError` MUST be returned.
- If the `payment` details supplied (e.g. `accountId`) are not considered [valid for reconciliation](#payment-reconciliation-detail-validation) by the <a>Booking System</a> then an `InvalidPaymentDetailsError` MUST be returned.


## Offer overrides

The unit price of an `OrderItem` MAY be overridden to allow for business models with variable pricing (where price differs from list price).

The <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> MUST have agreed an arrangement for offer overrides out-of-band, including which <a>Opportunities</a> and `Offer`s they may be applied to.

An `OfferOverride` type may be supplied by the <a>Broker</a> to the `acceptedOffer` property at <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a> and <a><b>P</b></a> or <a><b>B</b></a>. When an `OfferOverride` is used, it MUST be used consistently between <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a> and <a><b>P</b></a> or <a><b>B</b></a>, it MUST be used by the <a>Booking System</a> instead of `acceptedOffer` to calculate the tax and totals. It MAY be used for any `brokerRole`.

The `unitTaxSpecification` is calculated by the <a>Booking System</a> exactly as it would be for a standard `Offer`. The `price` of the `OfferOverride` may be zero, and also may be higher or lower than the available `Offer`s that exist in the <a>Booking System</a>.

`OfferOverride` MUST NOT be used when `isAccessibleForFree` is `true`, as free events cannot be overridden. Note that <a>Booking Systems</a> that _only_ offer <a>Free Opportunities</a> MUST NOT implement `OfferOverride` support, and must always throw an error when it is used.

The use of `OfferOverride` always creates the behaviour equivalent to `advanceBooking` and `prepayment` both being set to `https://openactive.io/Required`, and `availableChannel` having the value of `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingPrepayment`.

`latestCancellationBeforeStartDate` does not apply to `OfferOverride`, and is treated as unspecified. Hence cancellation is permissible based on the value `allowCustomerCancellationFullRefund` alone.

The <a>Booking System</a> MUST document the most comprehensive expected equivalent value of `openBookingFlowRequirement` that is applicable when an `OfferOverride` is requested by the <a>Broker</a>. This allows such <a>Brokers</a> to understand the features of this specification that may be used by the <a>Booking System</a>, and hence assess whether they are capable of completing the booking flow using `OfferOverride`.

<pre class="example" title="Example of OfferOverride">
  "acceptedOffer": {
    "@type": "OfferOverride",
    "description": "Winger space for Speedball.",
    "name": "Speedball winger position",
    "price": 10.00,
    "priceCurrency": "GBP"
  }
</pre>

## Currency support

This version of the specification does not support mixed currencies.

All `priceCurrency` values within an `Order`, `OrderQuote`, or `OrderProposal` must be identical.

# Order Operations

## Definition of a 'bookable' Opportunity and Offer pair

Before entering into the Booking Flow, the <a>Customer</a> MUST have selected at least one <a>bookable</a> pair of an <a>Opportunity</a> ("Yoga Tuesday 14th 7pm") with an associated `Offer` ("Junior (8-18) £9"), from the <a>Opportunity Data</a> [[RPDE]] open feeds. These pairs populate the `acceptedOffer` and `orderedItem` properties within the `OrderItem`s.

The pairing of an <a>Opportunity</a> of type `Event`, `ScheduledSession`, `HeadlineEvent`, `Slot` or `CourseInstance` with an `Offer` is deemed to be <dfn data-lt="bookability">bookable</dfn> via the Open Booking API if the `Offer` is applicable to the <a>Opportunity</a> following the principles of `Offer` inheritance contained in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]], and if both the <a>Opportunity</a> and `Offer` meet the criteria specified below.

<a>Bookable</a> `Offer`s:

- Include an <a>`@id`</a>.

- `availableChannel` of the `Offer` includes `https://openactive.io/OpenBookingPrepayment`.

- `advanceBooking` of the `Offer` is not equal to `https://openactive.io/Unavailable`.

- The `Offer` is current based on `validFromBeforeStartDate`.

<a>Bookable</a> <a>Opportunities</a>:

- Include an <a>`@id`</a>.

- Include an <a>`@id`</a> of an `Organization` or `Person` within the `organizer` or `provider` properties (i.e. the ID of the <a>Seller</a>).

- The `endDate` is not already in the past (note that bookings are still possible after the `startDate`).

- The `eventStatus` of the `Event`, `ScheduledSession`, or `Slot` is not `https://schema.org/EventCancelled` or `https://schema.org/EventPostponed`.

- The `remainingAttendeeCapacity` or `remainingUses` is greater than the number required.

- The `validFromBeforeStartDate` duration (if provided) subtracted from the `startDate` in the past. This allows for a "bookahead" window to be specified.

- The `taxMode` (`https://openactive.io/TaxNet` or `https://openactive.io/TaxGross`) is specified within the `Organization` or `Person` that is included in the REQUIRED `organizer` or `provider` properties.

- The <a>Broker</a> has machine readable permission to access the relevant instance of a compliant Open Booking API provided by the <a>Booking System</a> via an API key or similar token.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT attempt to book an <a>Opportunity</a> that is not <a>bookable</a> by the above criteria. The <a>Booking System</a> MUST include an `error` of value `OpportunityOfferPairNotBookableError` against each `OrderItem` in the `OrderQuote` that is not <a>bookable</a>.

The <a>Booking System</a> MUST include the `openBookingFlowRequirement` property within the `Offer`s in the <a>Opportunity Data</a> [[RPDE]] open feeds, only if any features of the specification covered by this property are required to book the `Offer`. This allows <a>Brokers</a> that do not support the specified features to easily filter out such `Offer`s from their experience. The `openBookingFlowRequirement` property MUST NOT be included in the request or response of any of the [endpoints](#endpoints) defined within this specification. 

### Booking restrictions

Note that although the <a>Customer</a> may be ineligible to attend a <a>bookable</a> <a>Opportunity</a> via an associated <a>bookable</a> `Offer` based on the `genderRestriction` or `ageRestriction` of either the <a>Opportunity</a> or `Offer`, this specification encourages the <a>Broker</a> NOT to capture additional personal data about the <a>Customer</a> (e.g. gender and date of birth) and NOT to enforce validation of these restrictions using such data, but instead to prominently communicate clear messaging regarding such restrictions throughout the booking process to ensure that the <a>Customer</a> is aware of these and able to make an informed decision.

There may be additional restrictions placed on an <a>Opportunity</a> by the <a>Seller</a>. For example, it may be that one of the party must be over a certain age as a supervising adult if some of the party are minors. It is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> and <a>Seller</a> to make such restrictions available as an array of `oa:additionalAdmissionRestriction` on the `SessionSeries`, `FacilityUse`, `Event`, `HeadlineEvent` or `CourseInstance`, and the <a>Broker</a> MUST communicate these restrictions clearly during the booking process.

The <a>Broker</a> MAY filter the `Offer`s it makes available to the <a>Customer</a>, for example based on `ageRestriction` of the `Offer`.


### Opportunity data properties

For requests to <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, <a><b>P</b></a>, and <a><b>B</b></a>, and for items in the <a>Orders feed</a>, the <a>Opportunity Data</a> within the `orderedItem` property of an `OrderItem` MUST only include the properties `@type` and <a>`@id`</a>. The `orderedItem` property of all `OrderItem`s MAY be excluded from the <a>Orders feed</a> if the <a>Booking System</a> does not support <a>Replacement</a>.

For responses from <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, <a><b>P</b></a>, and <a><b>B</b></a>, and from the <a>Order Status</a> endpoint, the <a>Opportunity Data</a> within the `orderedItem` property of an `OrderItem` MUST correspond exactly with the model used within the <a>Opportunity Data</a> [[RPDE]] open feeds. For example if properties within a `SessionSeries` and `ScheduledSession` are used in the open feeds, corresponding properties must be used within objects of the same types within the `orderedItem`.

See the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification for more information on these types.

For such responses, the <a>Opportunity Data</a> MUST include the following properties:

- `@type`
- <a>`@id`</a> and `name` of the <a>bookable</a> <a>Opportunity</a>
- `url`
- `location` (including `name`, and either or ideally both of `address` or `geo`)
- `activity`
- `startDate`

For such responses, the following properties are RECOMMENDED:

- `endDate`
- `duration`
- `ageRange`
- `genderRestriction`
- `eventStatus`
- `maximumAttendeeCapacity` or `maximumUses`
- `remainingAttendeeCapacity` or `remainingUses`

For such responses, the <a>Opportunity Data</a> MUST NOT include the following properties:

- `offers` (as the relevant `Offer` will be returned in `acceptedOffer`)
- `subEvent` or `event` (as the opportunity should be <a>bookable</a>, and therefore of sufficient granularity)
- `organizer` or `provider` (as this is provided by the `seller` property of the `Order`)

Where relevant it is expected that the <a>Opportunity Data</a> for such responses includes `superEvent` or `facilityUse` to allow for a `SessionSeries` or `FacilityUse` to be referenced from a `SessionSeries` or `Slot`, for example.

### `acceptedOffer` properties

The <a>Booking System</a> MUST include all applicable properties within the `acceptedOffer` consistently in responses to <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, <a><b>P</b></a>, and <a><b>B</b></a>. `acceptedOffer` MUST also include the same properties in the <a>Orders feed</a>, unless the <a>Booking System</a> does not support <a>Replacement</a>.


## Amending the OrderQuote before <a><b>B</b></a>

The <a>Broker</a> MAY call <a><b>C1</b></a> and MUST call <a><b>C2</b></a> when the <a>Customer</a> updates their basket to add and remove items.

When repeated calls to <a><b>C1</b></a> or <a><b>C2</b></a> are made with the same <a>Order UUID</a>, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST update any associated <a>Lease</a> to match the latest set of `OrderItem`s by removing those `OrderItem` that are not present in the request from the <a>Lease</a>, and adding those `OrderItem` that have been added since the last call to the <a>Lease</a>.

<a>Leases</a> may be cancelled by the <a>Broker</a> as a courtesy by submitting an OrderQuote Deletion request using the same <a>Order UUID</a>. The <a>Broker</a> SHOULD make a reasonable attempt to cancel all <a>Leases</a> when it is aware that a <a>Customer</a> has abandoned their journey, or if an error occurs and a new <a>Order UUID</a> is to be generated for the same customer. This increases the likelihood of an <a>Opportunity</a> being booked with one space remaining.

For <a>Booking Systems</a> that have not implemented leasing, an OrderQuote Deletion request MUST simply return a 204 success status in all cases.

## Cancellation after <a><b>B</b></a>

Either the whole `Order` or individual `OrderItem`s within the `Order` may be cancelled after <a><b>B</b></a>, however `OrderItem`s cannot be added or removed inside an existing `Order` past this point, within this version of the specification.

The cancellation may be requested by either the <a>Customer</a> or the <a>Seller</a>, and results in an updated `Order` item on the <a>Orders feed</a>. Once a cancellation status is placed on an `OrderItem` within an `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> it is assumed by the <a>Booking System</a> to have been processed, and it MUST NOT be reversed. A new `Order` will need to created to reinstate the booking.

### Refund after the opportunity has occurred 

Although a cancellation may be requested before the <a>Opportunity</a> has occurred in order to trigger a refund, cancellation and refund after an <a>Opportunity</a> has occurred, or when an `OrderItem` has `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/CustomerAttended` (e.g. when an attendee arrives early), is currently outside the scope of this specification.

Hence within this version of the specification any `OrderItem` <a>`@id`</a> submitted to the <a>Order Cancellation</a> endpoint MUST reference an <a>Opportunity</a> with a `startDate` in the future.

Full and partial refunds after an <a>Opportunity</a> has occurred MUST be handled out-of-band directly between the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a>.

### Customer requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="customercancelled.png" alt="Customer requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Customer requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

To cancel an existing `OrderItem`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST:

1. Use the latest state of the `Order` stored during the booking flow and updated via the <a>Orders feed</a> to determine which `OrderItem`s may be cancelled and refunded. If `orderItemStatus` is not yet set to `https://openactive.io/CustomerAttended`, and `allowCustomerCancellationFullRefund` is `true`, and either `latestCancellationBeforeStartDate` is unspecified and `startDate` is in the future, or `latestCancellationBeforeStartDate` subtracted from the <a>Opportunity</a> `startDate` is in the future, a PATCH against the `Order` including the `OrderItem` with `"orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled"` SHOULD succeed.

2. Inform the <a>Customer</a> of the refund being requested before they commit to cancellation, using the existing data available in the stored `Order` to communicate the `OrderItem`s that are included in the full refund request. 

3. Submit a PATCH to the <a>Order Cancellation</a> endpoint for the `Order` including only the <a>`@id`</a> for each of the `OrderItem`s to be cancelled, with an `"orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled"` set on each. On success, a status code 204 response will be received, without any body. On failure a status code 400 response will be received, containing a `CancellationNotPermittedError` error including a `description` of the reason, which SHOULD be communicated to the <a>Customer</a>. 

4. Process any refunds based on the resulting updates to the <a>Orders feed</a>, based on the updated `totalPaymentDue`. Successfully cancelled `OrderItem`s will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled`. Note refunds MUST NOT be processed except in response to updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

To cancel an entire `Order`, the PATCH request MUST include `"orderItemStatus": "https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled"` for each `OrderItem` within it.

Note that there is no provision for a <a>Customer</a> to cancel an `Order` after the cancellation window specified by `latestCancellationBeforeStartDate`. They may wish to do this out of politeness even though no refund is possible, with the benefit that their place may be taken by another <a>Customer</a>, which can be included in future versions of this specification.


### Seller requested cancellation

<figure>
 <img src="sellercancelled.png" alt="Seller requested cancellation">
 <figcaption>Seller requested cancellation</figcaption>
</figure>

`OrderItem`s cancelled by the <a>Seller</a> will have `orderItemStatus` set to `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and will optionally include a `cancellationMessage`. Refunds MUST be processed in response to the resulting updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and the <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified with the `cancellationMessage` if provided.



## Orders feed: Notifications, updates and refunds

An <dfn>Orders feed</dfn>, which is a secure [[RPDE]] feed of `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s, MUST be provided by the <a>Booking System</a>, with the contents of the feed specific to the authenticating <a>Broker</a>. As noted in <a href="#new-orders-and-orderproposals">New Orders and OrderProposals</a>, this list must include all, and only, `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s that have been updated by the <a>Booking System</a> subsequent to successful completion of <a><b>B</b></a> or <a><b>P</b></a>, respectively. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to maintain an updated state of all their bookings across a number of <a>Booking Systems</a>, even when changes are made outside of the <a>Broker</a>.

The <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT communicate directly with the <a>Customer</a> using the personal details supplied by the <a>Broker</a>, and MUST instead update the <a>Orders feed</a> and <a>Opportunity data</a> to instruct the <a>Broker</a> to send appropriate notifications. This allows the <a>Broker</a> to handle refunds to cancellations, and process notifications to <a>Customers</a> in a consistent way.

### Orders Feed Inconsistencies

An error condition exists where an unrecognised `Order` or `OrderProposal` item is found by the <a>Broker</a> on the feed. Due to the `Order` or `OrderProposal` being stored during the <a>Payment Authorisation</a> stage, the <a>Broker</a> should always have a matching `Order` or `OrderProposal` for any <a>Order UUID</a> on the <a>Orders feed</a> even if it has been soft-deleted. This would make an unrecognised `Order` or `OrderProposal` an impossible scenario, and hence an unrecognised `Order` or `OrderProposal` should be logged as a serious error within the <a>Broker</a> and promptly investigated.

The RPDE `id` of an `OrderProposal` MUST differ from the RPDE `id` of its related `Order`. The `OrderProposal` is marked as `deleted` at <a><b>B</b></a>, and the related `Order` will not appear in the <a>Orders feed</a> until it is next updated.

An `Order` MUST NOT be set to `"state": "deleted"` in the <a>Orders feed</a> by the <a>Booking System</a>, except as a result of [Order Deletion](#order-deletion), or when authorisation to access a particular <a>Seller</a> has been revoked. An `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> marked as `deleted` outside of [Order Deletion](#order-deletion) should be logged as a serious error within the <a>Broker</a> and promptly investigated, and SHOULD NOT trigger an immediate deletion of the `Order` by the <a>Broker</a>, to allow for the issue to be resolved.


### Order stores with eventual consistency

It is important that the storage used by the <a>Broker</a> for `Order`s provides a [linearisability](https://aphyr.com/posts/313-strong-consistency-models) guarantee when `Order`s are retrieved by ID, due to the partial updates that are applied to it from the <a>Orders feed</a> and the creation of the initial `Order` being synchronous.

### Booking System: Updating the Orders feed

The <a>Booking System</a> must ensure that the `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> represent the current state of `OrderItem`s within the system, for the properties included in the feed. Hence any change to any property within an `Order` or `OrderProposal` in the feed MUST result in a change to the RPDE `modified` property associated with it.

#### `totalPaymentDue` invariant

In this version of the specification, the following constraints exist around the stored `Order` that are shared by both the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Booking System</a>:
- `OrderItem`s MUST NOT be added or removed inside an existing `Order` after <a><b>B</b></a>.
- The <a>Opportunity</a> (`orderedItem`) and `Offer` (`acceptedOffer`) of an `OrderItem` referenced within an `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY be updated to reference a different <a>bookable</a> <a>Opportunity</a> and `Offer` pair via <a>Replacement</a>, only if the `price` is less than or equal the previous `Offer` `price`, and if the `prepayment` value is the same.
- The `acceptedOffer` and `unitTaxSpecification` properties of an `OrderItem` referenced within an `Order` MUST always represent a snapshot of the `Offer` at the point it was booked, or the last <a>Replacement</a>.
- `OrderItem` cancellation MUST NOT be reversed.

Hence an invariant exists whereby the `totalPaymentDue` of an `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> MUST only ever decrease or remain unchanged due to `OrderItem` <a>Cancellation</a> or <a>Replacement</a>, and MUST NOT otherwise change or increase.

These constraints and invariant do not apply to `OrderProposal`s.

### Broker: Processing the Orders feed

The <a>Broker</a> MUST maintain an up-to-date store of `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s received from the <a>Booking System</a>. Each `Order` or `OrderProposal` received is compared to the last version stored by the <a>Broker</a>, and any differences between the old and new content can trigger notifications and refunds to the <a>Customer</a>, as well as updating the <a>Broker</a>'s store.

Hence it is important for the <a>Broker</a> to consider their store of `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s as durable, and not simply a cache, to ensure their <a>Customers</a> always get relevant notifications.

The `Order`/`OrderProposal` properties included in the <a>Orders feed</a> MUST be a subset of the `Order`/`OrderProposal` properties returned in the response from <a><b>B</b></a> or <a><b>P</b></a> as specified below (effectively making the <a>Orders feed</a> a series of partial update requests for the <a>Broker</a>). It is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to process the contents of the <a>Orders feed</a> in a manner that maintains a complete view of the `Order` state.

The following properties of the `Order` or `OrderProposal` MUST be included in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and the <a>Broker</a> MUST overwrite its previous copy of each property when processed:

* `totalPaymentTax` (if at least one `TaxChargeSpecification` exists for `totalPaymentTax`, and `taxCalculationExcluded` is not `true`)
* `totalPaymentDue`
* `orderProposalStatus` (`OrderProposal` only)
* `orderProposalVersion` (`OrderProposal` only)

Additionally, the `orderedItem` property of the `Order` or `OrderProposal` MUST be included in the <a>Orders feed</a>. Noting the exceptions outlined in this section, all other properties of the `OrderItem`s MUST overwrite the <a>Broker</a>'s previous copy of each when processed, and if a property is no longer present the <a>Broker</a> must remove it. This includes the following properties, and any additional supported [extensions](#booking-functionality-extensions):

For `OrderItem` in both `Order` and `OrderProposal`:
* `orderItemStatus`
* `allowCustomerCancellationFullRefund`
* `accessPass`
* `accessCode`
* `additionalProperty`
* `cancellationMessage`
* `customerNotice`
* `acceptedOffer`
* `unitTaxSpecification`
* `orderedItem` (including only `@type` and <a>`@id`</a> properties)

And for `OrderItem` in `OrderProposal` it additionally includes:
* `attendeeDetailsRequired`
* `attendee`
* `orderItemIntakeForm`
* `orderItemIntakeFormResponse`

As an exception to the above for `Order`s, if the `orderedItem` property is not present in the `OrderItem`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> (in the case that the <a>Booking System</a> does not support <a>Replacement</a>), the following properties are assumed to be immutable for that `Order`, and the <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT overwrite their previous copy of each (taken at <a><b>B</b></a>) when processing the <a>Orders feed</a>:
* `acceptedOffer`
* `unitTaxSpecification`
* `orderedItem`

The following properties MUST always be included in the <a>Orders feed</a> for the convenience of the <a>Broker</a>, and MUST be immutable:
* `@type`, <a>`@id`</a> and `identifier` (the <a>Order UUID</a>) of the `Order` or `OrderProposal`
* `@type` and <a>`@id`</a> of the `OrderItem`
* `taxCalculationExcluded` (only included if its value is `true`)

Additionally any properties within objects included in the properties above that were included in the original response from <a><b>B</b></a> or <a><b>P</b></a> MUST be included in the <a>Orders feed</a>, with the exception of the following.

The following properties MUST NOT be included in the <a>Orders feed</a> and MUST always be maintained by the <a>Broker</a> and not overwritten; hence changes to these properties MUST NOT be permitted after <a><b>B</b></a>:

Properties in `Order` and `OrderProposal`:
* `bookingService`
* `broker`
* `brokerRole`
* `seller`
* `customer`
* `orderNumber`
* `payment`

Properties in `OrderItem` within `Order` only:
* `attendeeDetailsRequired`
* `attendee`
* `orderItemIntakeForm`
* `orderItemIntakeFormResponse`

<a>Opportunity Data</a> updates for `Order`s MUST NOT be read from the <a>Orders feed</a>, and must instead be updated using the <a>Opportunity Data</a> [[RPDE]] open feeds as specified in [Change of logistics notification](#change-of-logistics-notifications).

<a>Brokers</a> reading `OrderItem`s in `OrderProposal`s, or <a>Replacements</a>, from the <a>Orders feed</a> MUST look up the `@type` and <a>`@id`</a> of each `orderedItem` against the <a>Opportunity Data</a> [[RPDE]] open feeds to retrieve the most up-to-date full <a>Opportunity</a>.

The <a>Broker</a> is expected to fully replace properties at the `Order`/`OrderProposal` level, in their entirety, as specified above, and MUST NOT perform a granular PATCH of nested properties within these. The rationale for this is that both [this specification](#model) and the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification on which this specification is based do not allow for explicit null values to exist within the model, which impedes property removal, and hinders any straightforward implementation of a granular PATCH.

Note that in this version of the specification, once an `Order` or `OrderProposal` has been created, only properties that are present in the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY be updated.

Note also that the representation of `Order`s within the <a>Orders feed</a> is designed specifically such that it does not include any personal data, except for that which is already available from the <a>Opportunity Data</a> [[RPDE]] open feeds provided by the <a>Booking System</a>.

<a>Brokers</a> MUST harvest the <a>Orders feed</a> with a frequency of at least once every 60 seconds to ensure expediency of updates and notifications to <a>Customers</a>.

### New `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s

A new `Order` MUST NOT be communicated externally by the <a>Broker</a> and other operations such as cancellation MUST NOT be possible until it has reached the `orderCreationStatus` of `https://openactive.io/OrderCreationComplete`, after which the `orderCreationStatus` can be completely ignored.

`OrderProposal`s MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a> based on a successful response to <a><b>P</b></a>, and `Order`s MUST be stored by the <a>Broker</a> based on a successful response to <a><b>B</b></a>.

New `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s MUST NOT be included in the feed until they have been updated at least once. This minimises the volume of updates in the <a>Orders feed</a>, and allows the polling frequency of the feed to be greatly reduced, which reduces the overall load on the <a>Booking System</a>.

Hence all `Order`s and `OrderProposal`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> will always be recognised by the <a>Broker</a> as updates to an existing stored `Order` or `OrderProposal`, and the <a>Broker</a> should treat any unrecognised `Order`s or `OrderProposal`s in the feed as a serious implementation error.


### Cancellation, replacement, refund calculation and notification

Regardless of the source of the cancellation, the process for refunding, notifying the <a>Customer</a>, and updating the <a>Broker</a>'s records is exactly the same.

There are two scenarios that can update the effective `OrderItem` composition of an `Order` found in the <a>Orders feed</a>:
- <dfn>Cancellation</dfn>: Updated `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled` or `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled` values for `orderItemStatus`, indicating the item is cancelled and a refund due if necessary.
- <dfn>Replacement</dfn>: Updated `@type` and <a>`@id`</a> within the `orderedItem`, and associated updates to `acceptedOffer` and `unitTaxSpecification`, indicating the item has been replaced by the <a>Seller</a> with an equivalent item of the same or lower `price`.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST process refunds for each new <a>Cancellation</a> or <a>Replacement</a> found in the feed, and it is the <a>Broker</a>'s responsibility to continually retry failed refund processing and escalate any processing failure to the <a>Customer</a> accordingly. Note that the <a>Orders feed</a> is "fire and forget" for the <a>Booking System</a>: once an `OrderItem` is updated with a cancellation status in the <a>Orders feed</a>, the status MUST NOT be reversed, and is assumed by the <a>Booking System</a> to be processed.

For a <a>Cancellation</a>, the snapshot contents of `acceptedOffer` (and `unitTaxSpecification`, if relevant) within the `OrderItem`s MUST remain unchanged by the <a>Booking System</a> after <a><b>B</b></a>, and new `totalPaymentDue` (and `totalPaymentTax`, if relevant) values MUST be calculated excluding `OrderItem`s with an `orderItemStatus` of either `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled` or `https://openactive.io/SellerCancelled`.

For a <a>Replacement</a>, an updated `acceptedOffer` (and `unitTaxSpecification`, if relevant) MAY be included in the `OrderItem`, and MUST then constitute a snapshot and MUST remain unchanged by the <a>Booking System</a> except for in the case of a further <a>Replacement</a>. The value of `prepayment` within the `acceptedOffer` MUST NOT be change through <a>Replacement</a>.

If the `totalPaymentDue` value of the `Order` has decreased (it is [not permitted to increase](#totalpaymentdue-invariant)) following one or more <a>Cancellations</a> or <a>Replacements</a> within an `Order`, the <a>Broker</a> MUST instruct the <a>Payment Provider</a> to issue a new <a>Refund</a> such that the new `totalPaymentDue` value of the `Order` is equal to the value of the associated <a>Payment</a> less all <a>Refunds</a> including the new one.

In all cases of the `Order` composition changing, the <a>Broker</a> MUST generate a new <a>Invoice</a> for the `Order` to replace the previous <a>Invoice</a>.

The <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified after a refund is successfully processed, with the <a>Broker</a> using the `orderItemStatus` or updated `orderedItem` to indicate the source of the refund.

If refund processing takes longer than 1 minute, then the <a>Customer</a> must be notified immediately of a <a>Cancellation</a> or <a>Replacement</a> ahead of the notification of the completed refund. This ensures the <a>Seller</a> can rely on the <a>Broker</a> as a notification channel. The <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified with the `cancellationMessage` (for <a>Cancellation</a>) or `customerNotice` (for <a>Replacement</a>) for the `OrderItem`, if provided.

Note that the <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified in the event of all <a>Cancellations</a> or <a>Replacements</a>, even if no refund is due (e.g. for <a>Free Opportunities</a>).

If the <a>Booking System</a> does not support <a>Replacement</a>, it MAY consistently exclude all three of the properties `orderedItem`, `acceptedOffer` and `unitTaxSpecification` from all `OrderItem`s in the <a>Orders feed</a>.

### Partial Refunds and out-of-band arrangements

This version of the specification does not allow a refund to be processed (in full or in part) by the <a>Booking System</a> without going via the <a>Broker</a> for any `Order` that has been placed via the <a>Broker</a>. <a>Booking Systems</a> MUST disable their own refund functionality for `Order`s placed via a <a>Broker</a> - only allowing Seller requested cancellations which trigger the <a>Broker</a> to provide full item refunds - to ensure that the book keeping and invoices of the <a>Broker</a> are not invalidated.

Partial refunds MAY be handled by out-of-band arrangements between the <a>Broker</a> and the <a>Seller</a> provided they do not have any affect on the Open Booking API interface. For example, the <a>Broker</a> could issue a partial refund and then reassign the remaining funds as a cancellation penalty via a new invoice handled and reconciled directly with the <a>Seller</a> outside the scope of the <a>Booking System</a> and this specification.


### Customer notice notifications

The <a>Seller</a> may provide a notice to the <a>Customer</a> ahead of an <a>Opportunity</a>, for example to inform <a>Customers</a> that they are still short of a player in case any friends are interested in attending.

An `orderedItem` within the `OrderItem` of the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY be updated to include a `customerNotice`. The <a>Customer</a> MUST be notified with the contents of the `customerNotice` for the `OrderItem` if it differs from the value of `customerNotice` for that specific `orderedItem` that the <a>Broker</a> had previously stored (or if a new `Order` in the <a>Orders feed</a> includes a `customerNotice`).

Note that notifications that inform the <a>Customer</a> of substantive changes to the <a>Opportunity</a> MUST be triggered by updating the <a>Opportunity Data</a>, which will trigger a [Change of logistics notification](#change-of-logistics-notifications), instead of using the `customerNotice` mechanism.


### Change of logistics notifications

The `orderedItem` within the `OrderItem` includes an <a>`@id`</a> reference to an <a>Opportunity</a>, which MUST be able to be cross-referenced with other sources of <a>Opportunity Data</a>, for example an [[RPDE]] open feed.

This specification requires the <a>Orders feed</a> to not include the full contents of the <a>Opportunities</a> within the `orderedItem`, and instead only includes the <a>Opportunity</a> properties `@type` and <a>`@id`</a>. Additionally the `orderedItem` property of the `OrderItem` is only required within the <a>Orders feed</a> if <a>Replacement</a> is supported.

Hence the <a>Broker</a> MUST store the <a>Opportunity</a> references `@type` and <a>`@id`</a> at <a><b>B</b></a>, MUST monitor the <a>Opportunity Data</a> open feeds for updates to the referenced information, and MUST provide a notification to the <a>Customer</a> for substantive changes to the same <a>Opportunity</a>; specifically: any changes to the <a>Opportunity</a> `name`, `startDate`, `endDate`, `duration` or `meetingPoint` properties, and any changes to the `name`, `address` or `geo` properties within `location`.



### Opportunity attendance updates

When a <a>Customer</a> has been confirmed as attending an <a>Opportunity</a> that was booked via an `Order`, the <a>Booking System</a> SHOULD update the `Order` within the <a>Orders feed</a> by setting `orderItemStatus` for the relevant `OrderItem` to `https://openactive.io/CustomerAttended`.

### Other notifications

The following properties within `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY also be updated by the <a>Booking System</a>, and MUST trigger the <a>Broker</a> to notify the <a>Customer</a>: 

* `accessCode` and/or `accessPass` - A notification that the access details for the <a>Opportunity</a> have changed

The following properties within `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY be updated by the <a>Booking System</a>, and MUST be reflected to the <a>Customer</a> in any user interface during their normal interaction with the <a>Broker</a>:

* `allowCustomerCancellationFullRefund` - Automated cancellation with a full refund is no longer possible via the <a>Broker</a>.

The following properties within `Order`s in the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY also be updated by the <a>Booking System</a>, and MUST be used subsequently by the <a>Broker</a> for their internal operations:

* `additionalProperty` - The details to use for payment reconciliation have changed


## Amending the Order after <a><b>B</b></a>

`OrderItem`s cannot be added or removed within an existing `Order` under any circumstances in this version of the specification, and are not permitted to be replaced by the <a>Broker</a> (only the <a>Seller</a> may provide a <a>Replacement</a>). Hence to make such changes, a new `Order` must be created, and the old `Order` cancelled.

For the common case of rescheduling a `SessionSeries` or `FacilityUse` booking, the following steps are RECOMMENDED for the <a>Broker</a>:

1. Request an `OrderQuote` for the new `orderItem`s with a newly generated <a>Order UUID</a>, using <a><b>C2</b></a>.

2. Check the latest stored state of `Order`s from the <a>Orders feed</a> to ensure that old `OrderItem` allows `allowCustomerCancellationFullRefund`.

3. Clearly communicate messaging to the <a>Customer</a> that explains that this transaction will involve a refund and new purchase, and so they will expect a refund for the old item and a new transaction for the new one. Information should be communicated to the <a>Customer</a> if any price difference exists between the two `Order`s, for the <a>Customer</a> to confirm.

4. Request new payment details from the <a>Customer</a> and Authorise the amount specified by <a><b>C2</b></a>, then PATCH the old `Order` via the <a>Order Cancellation</a> endpoint, and if successful, complete <a><b>B</b></a> as normal.

The new `Order` is completed as described in the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow), and the existing `OrderItem` is cancelled with the refund processed as described elsewhere.


## Delivery of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy

The <a>Broker</a> MUST make the <a>Customer</a> aware of any `termsOfService` provided within the `seller`, `broker`, and `bookingService` (which may include Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy) before the <a>Customer</a> confirms their purchase.

If `requiresExplicitConsent` is `true` for any `termsOfService` then the <a>Customer</a> MUST only be allowed to proceed if they have explicitly acted to consent to the most recently modified version of such terms, identified by `dateModified` and the `url`, before the <a>Customer</a> completes <a><b>B</b></a>.

The <a>Broker</a> MAY remember the consent previously given by the <a>Customer</a> based on the `url` and `dateModified` of the `Terms`, only if `dateModified` is provided, and if consent for storing such preferences is given by the <a>Customer</a>.

Since, during booking, the details of the <a>Customer</a> are provided to the <a>Booking System</a> and the <a>Seller</a>, the <a>Broker</a> MUST inform the <a>Customer</a> of any implications with respect to the GDPR or other data protection legislation.

Note that `termsOfService` may only be specified at the `seller`, `broker` or `bookingService` level within the `Order`, and may not be provided for a specific `Offer` or `OrderItem`.

<pre class="example" title="Properties for Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy">
  "termsOfService": [
    {
      "@type": "Terms",
      "name": "Privacy Policy",
      "url": "https://example.com/privacy-policy",
      "requiresExplicitConsent": false
    },
    {
      "@type": "Terms",
      "name": "Terms and Conditions",
      "url": "https://example.com/terms-and-conditions",
      "dateModified": "2020-02-16T20:31:13Z",
      "requiresExplicitConsent": true
    }
  ]
</pre>

The URLs in the example are only illustrative.


## Access control

For <a>Opportunities</a> that require entry into a restricted building or area to participate, it is REQUIRED that `OrderItem` include unique access control data within `accessCode` and `accessPass`. An `accessCode` SHOULD be provided for manual use in the event that an `accessPass` fails.

Each `accessCode` and `accessPass` MUST represent unique methods of entry, and MUST NOT be duplicated in different formats. For example, multiple formats (e.g. PNG, JPEG) of the same `accessPass` MUST NOT be supplied.

A <a>Broker</a> MUST make all supplied `accessPass`es and `accessCode`s available to the <a>Customer</a>, with the exception of `Barcode`s that do not have fallback image `url`. `Barcode`s without a `url` MAY be ignored if the <a>Broker</a> is unable to process them. 

### Text-based access control

PIN codes, Order identifiers, or simply the e-mail address of the <a>Customer</a> are all permissible for the purposes of access control.

In keeping with the Schema.org definition of `PropertyValue`, the `name` property SHOULD be used for the name of the property, and the `description` property SHOULD be used for any human-readable access control code(s). 

<pre class="example" title="Example of accessCode used for a PIN Code">
  "accessCode": [
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "PIN Code",
      "description": "1234"
    }
  ],
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Example of accessCode used for a booking reference">
  "accessCode": [
    {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "name": "Booking Reference",
      "description": "123456789"
    }
  ],
</pre>

### Image-based access control

Images to be displayed to provide access, for example access tickets rendered by the booking system, MAY be included as an `ImageObject` within the `accessPass` array.

`ImageObject` MUST NOT be used for fallback images of a `Barcode`; the `url` property of the `Barcode` MUST be used for this purpose.

<pre class="example" title="Example of ImageObject in accessPass">
  "accessPass": [
    {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://access.example.com/476ac24c694da79c5e33731ebbb5f1"
    }
  ],
</pre>

### Extension point for barcode-based access control

Access barcodes to be rendered by the <a>Broker</a> MAY be included as a `Barcode` within the `accessPass` array. Note that `Barcode` subclasses `ImageObject`, allowing it to contain a fallback rendered barcode image `url` in addition to the raw barcode details. `Barcode`s SHOULD include a fallback image `url`.

Due to the variety of barcode formats available, the specification expects the `Barcode` to include additional properties using a custom namespace (as specified in the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification), enough to allow the barcode to be reproduced by the <a>Broker</a>. This will help inform future versions of the specification.

Additionally where use of an existing barcode is desirable (for example, the barcode on a <a>Broker</a>'s own membership card) the <a>Broker</a> MAY include a `Barcode` in the `accessPass` property against individual `OrderItem`s in the request to <a><b>B</b></a>. If the <a>Booking System</a> is able to accept such existing barcodes, it MUST reflect back the specified `Barcode` in the `accessPass` array in the response along with any other valid access control options.

<pre class="example" title="Example of Barcode in accessPass">
  "accessPass": [
    {
      "@type": "Barcode",
      "url": "https://fallback.image.example.com/476ac24c694da79c5e33731ebbb5f1",
      "text": "0123456789",
      "bookwhen:codeType": "code128"
    }
  ],
</pre>

# Endpoints

This API has been defined around the concept of API discovery, using the [[Dataset-API-Discovery]] specification as a basis. This allows a <dfn>Base URI</dfn>, as defined in [[RFC3986]], to be discovered by the <a>Broker</a>, and for such a <a>Base URI</a> to vary based on the naming conventions of each <a>Booking System</a>.

All <a>Booking System</a> endpoints defined in this specification MUST be idempotent.


## Paths and Verbs

Due to API discovery, the paths specified are relative to the <a>Base URI</a>. This <a>Base URI</a> must be used consistently within an implementation. It is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> to advertise the <a>Base URI</a> via the [[Dataset-API-Discovery]] specification.

The absolute URL of the <a>Orders feed</a> MAY be separately discoverable, independently of the <a>Base URI</a>, provided that such discovery is consistent with the [[Dataset-API-Discovery]] specification. If such an absolute URL is available, it MUST be used instead of the relative path defined within this specification.

With the exception of the <a>Orders feed</a>, all endpoints MUST accept an <a>Order UUID</a> as the final segment of their path. This is indicated by the placeholder `{uuid}` in the relative paths in the table below. The value of this <a>Order UUID</a> is supplied by the <a>Broker</a>, as described throughout this specification.

<a>Brokers</a> MUST only access the endpoints using the paths described in this specification, with the exception of the absolute URL of the <a>Orders feed</a>, if available.


A summary of endpoints defined by this specification is provided:

| Endpoint Name                     | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| OrderQuote Creation <a><b>C1</b></a>   | REQUIRED    | Yes  | OrderQuote       | PUT       | `/order-quote-templates/{uuid}`|
| OrderQuote Creation <a><b>C2</b></a>   | REQUIRED    | Yes  | OrderQuote       | PUT       | `/order-quotes/{uuid}`         |
| <a>OrderQuote Deletion</a>        | REQUIRED    |      | OrderQuote       | DELETE    | `/order-quotes/{uuid}`         |
| OrderProposal Creation <a><b>P</b></a> | OPTIONAL    | Yes  | OrderProposal    | PUT       | `/order-proposals/{uuid}`      |
| <a>OrderProposal Update</a>       | OPTIONAL    |      | OrderProposal    | PATCH     | `/order-proposals/{uuid}`      |
| Order Creation <a><b>B</b></a>              | REQUIRED    | Yes  | Order            | PUT       | `/orders/{uuid}`               |
| <a>Order Deletion</a>             | REQUIRED    |      | Order            | DELETE    | `/orders/{uuid}`               |
| <a>Order Cancellation</a>         | REQUIRED    |      | Order            | PATCH     | `/orders/{uuid}`               |
| [Orders RPDE Feed](#orders-rpde-feed) | REQUIRED | Yes  | Orders feed      | GET       | `/orders-rpde`                 |
| <a>Order Status</a>               | RECOMMENDED | Yes  | Order            | GET       | `/orders/{uuid}`               |

Note that for simple implementations, <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a> can be handled by same underlying code.

### Order Endpoint RESTful Semantics

Note that practically all `Order` endpoints above (those that relate to `Order` or its subclasses `OrderQuote` and `OrderProposal`) share the same <a>Order UUID</a> namespace, and can be successfully implemented with a single underlying `Order` record behind them all. These endpoints are distinct purely to reduce the logic required in each and to increase testability and maintainability.

An `Order` with a particular <a>Order UUID</a> MUST only exist as either an `Order`, `OrderQuote` or `OrderProposal` at a single point in time.

Hence the Order Status endpoint SHOULD return any stored `Order`, `OrderQuote` or `OrderProposal` with that <a>Order UUID</a>, and the <a>Orders feed</a> MUST return both `Order` and `OrderProposal` items (noting that `OrderQuote` are not included in the <a>Orders feed</a>).

To aid the reader in their semantic reasoning, from a REST perspective, there are four resources:
- `/order-quote-templates` and `/order-quotes` - both are a collection resource of `OrderQuote`s. These are always ephemeral, so are created only for the duration of the PUT request, unless the <a>Booking System</a> chooses to persist them, in which case they exist until the <a>Lease</a> expires or an `OrderProposal` or `Order` is created. If persisted, `/order-quote-templates` appear immediately in `/order-quotes`, in order that they can be deleted via [OrderQuote Deletion](#orderquote-deletion).
- `/order-proposals` - a collection resource of `OrderProposal`s, which are deleted when a corresponding `Order` is created.
- `/orders` - a collection resource of `Order`s which includes its subclasses `OrderQuote`s and `OrderProposal`s



## Request and Response

This section includes request and response examples for each of the endpoints specified in this API.

### OrderQuote Creation C1

| Endpoint Name                 | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| OrderQuote Creation <dfn><b>C1</b></dfn> | REQUIRED    | Yes  | OrderQuote       | PUT       | `/order-quote-templates/{uuid}`|

The <a><b>C1</b></a> is an endpoint that accepts an `OrderQuote` without a `customer` object to check availability and confirm that the specific combination of `OrderItem`s requested can be purchased.

A PUT request to this endpoint of the <a>Booking System</a> with an object of type `OrderQuote` will return an `OrderQuote` which represents a "dry run" of the booking, with the state of the `Order` nearly identical to the result of <a><b>B</b></a> (except it excludes `customer`, `attendee`, `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` and the `payment` `identifier`), without any side effects (with the exception of optional leasing).

Note that in a simple implementation that does not manage <a>Lease</a> state, attendee details, or additional details, <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a> can be handled by the same underlying code that simply validates the `email` of the `customer` only if a `customer` value is supplied. Even for complex implementations, given the similarities between <a><b>C1</b></a> and <a><b>C2</b></a>, much of the business logic can be shared between both.

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C1: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC1Request">
</pre>

If successful the <a>Booking System</a> will respond with an OrderQuote:

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C1: example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC1Response">
</pre>

If there are any issues with the `OrderItem`s requested in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response (as the error is expected to be resolved, and the request resubmitted, as per [[RFC2616]]), with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem`. Note that `totalPaymentDue` and `totalPaymentTax` MUST be calculated _including_ any `OrderItem`s that exclusively contain `IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError` or `IncompleteIntakeFormError` `error`s, and _excluding_ any `OrderItem`s that include any other `error`s.

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C1: example OrderItem error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC1OrderItemErrorResponse">
</pre>

If there are issues with other properties of the `OrderQuote` outside of `orderedItem`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a JSON-LD response which includes only the appropriate `OpenBookingError` and the appropriate status code.

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C1: example failure response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC1ErrorResponse">
</pre>


### OrderQuote Creation C2

| Endpoint Name                 | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| OrderQuote Creation <dfn><b>C2</b></dfn> | REQUIRED    | Yes  | OrderQuote       | PUT       | `/order-quotes/{uuid}`         |

The <a><b>C2</b></a> is PUT endpoint that accepts an `OrderQuote` with a `customer` object to check availability and confirm that the specific combination of `OrderItem`s requested can be purchased. 

A PUT request to this endpoint of the <a>Booking System</a> with an object of type `OrderQuote` will return an `OrderQuote` which represents a "dry run" of the booking, with the state of the `Order` nearly identical to the result of <a><b>B</b></a> (except it excludes `payment` `identifier`), without any side effects (with the exception of optional leasing).

Note that the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT store any personal information of the `customer` provided for the `OrderQuote` past the expiry of any associated <a>Lease</a> created.

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C2: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC2Request">
</pre>

If successful the <a>Booking System</a> will respond with an OrderQuote:

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C2: example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC2Response">
</pre>

Note if the response includes `orderRequiresApproval` with a value of `true` the <a>Broker</a> MUST make it clear to the <a>Customer</a> of the additional process they are about to enter into, and once they are aware, move forward according to the [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval) rather than the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow).

If there are any issues with the `OrderItem`s requested in the `OrderQuote`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a `409 Conflict` response (as the error is expected to be resolved, and the request resubmitted, as per [[RFC2616]]), with `error` details provided against each offending `OrderItem`. Note that `totalPaymentDue` and `totalPaymentTax` MUST be calculated _including_ any `OrderItem`s that exclusively contain `IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError` or `IncompleteIntakeFormError` `error`s, and _excluding_ any `OrderItem`s that include any other `error`s.

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C2: example OrderItem error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC2OrderItemErrorResponse">
</pre>

If there are issues with other properties of the `OrderQuote` outside of `orderedItem`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with a JSON-LD response which includes only the appropriate `OpenBookingError` and the appropriate status code.

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Creation C2: example failure response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteCreationC2ErrorResponse">
</pre>

### OrderQuote Deletion

| Endpoint Name                     | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| <dfn>OrderQuote Deletion</dfn>        | REQUIRED    |      | OrderQuote       | DELETE    | `/order-quotes/{uuid}`         |

Deleting an `OrderQuote` releases any <a>Lease</a> associated with it, which the <a>Broker</a> SHOULD do as a courtesy if the <a>Customer</a> has abandoned their journey. An OrderQuote Deletion request MUST simply return a 204 success status in all cases (including cases where the <a>Booking Systems</a> has not implemented leasing), as the `OrderQuote` itself is ephemeral.

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Deletion: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteDeletionRequest">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="OrderQuote Deletion: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderQuoteDeletionResponse">
</pre>

### OrderProposal Creation P

| Endpoint Name                 | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| OrderProposal Creation <dfn><b>P</b></dfn> | OPTIONAL    | Yes  | OrderProposal    | PUT       | `/order-proposals/{uuid}`      |

<a><b>P</b></a> is a PUT endpoint that creates and returns the submitted `OrderProposal` with an `orderProposalStatus` of `https://openactive.io/AwaitingSellerConfirmation`. The details submitted are identical to those required for <a><b>B</b></a> with the addition of an optional `lease`.

<pre class="example" title="OrderProposal Creation: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderProposalCreationRequest">
</pre>

If successful the <a>Booking System</a> will respond with an `OrderProposal`:

<pre class="example" title="OrderProposal Creation: example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderProposalCreationResponse">
</pre>

If there are issues with any properties of the `OrderProposal`, including the `orderedItem`, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST respond with an error response which includes only the appropriate `OpenBookingError` and the appropriate status code. The <a>Broker</a> is expected to retry the `OrderQuote` to get specific `orderedItem` level errors.

<pre class="example" title="OrderProposal Creation: example failure response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderProposalCreationErrorResponse">
</pre>

Note that any validation errors raised at <a><b>P</b></a> regarding any property values MUST also be raised at <a><b>C2</b></a> (and ideally also <a><b>C1</b></a> if relevant), so it should be very unusual to receive an error at <a><b>P</b></a>.


### OrderProposal Update

| Endpoint Name                 | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| <dfn>OrderProposal Update</dfn>       | OPTIONAL    |      | OrderProposal    | PATCH     | `/order-proposals/{uuid}`      |

The endpoint accepts a simple PATCH containing either or both of `orderProposalStatus` and `orderCustomerNote`.

<pre class="example" title="OrderProposal Update: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderProposalUpdateRequest">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="OrderProposal Update: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderProposalUpdateResponse">
</pre>

A PATCH to update `orderProposalStatus` MUST have the value `https://openactive.io/CustomerRejected`, as that is the only permissible value based on the logic defined in this version of the specification. If another value for `orderProposalStatus` is specified the endpoint MUST return an `PatchNotAllowedOnProperty` error with its status code.

<pre class="example" title="OrderProposal Update: example property error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderProposalUpdateErrorResponse">
</pre>

If the PATCH request includes any properties other than `@type`, `@context`, `orderProposalStatus` and `orderCustomerNote` (excluding any properties with a custom namespace), the endpoint MUST return a `PatchContainsExcessiveProperties` error with its status code.

<pre class="example" title="OrderProposal Update: example property error response for excessive properties" data-transform="dataExampleOrderProposalUpdateExcessivePropertiesErrorResponse">
</pre>

### Order Creation B

| Endpoint Name                     | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Order Creation <dfn><b>B</b></dfn>       | REQUIRED    | Yes  | Order            | PUT       | `/orders/{uuid}`               |


A PUT request to the Order Creation endpoint of the <a>Booking System</a> with an object of type `Order` will create the `Order` and complete the booking from the point of the view of the <a>Booking System</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationRequest">
</pre>

For the `Order` response and the <a>Orders feed</a>, the `OrderItem`s MUST include a unique <a>`@id`</a>. This allows `OrderItem`s to be referenced in subsequent PATCH calls once the `Order` has been created.

If successful the <a>Booking System</a> will respond with a newly created `Order` resource:

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: example response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationResponse">
</pre>

Technical or conformance issues with any properties of the `Order`, including in an `orderedItem`, MUST cause the <a>Booking System</a> to respond with only the appropriate `OpenBookingError` and associated status code. Following an `UnableToProcessOrderItemError` or `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError`, the <a>Broker</a> is expected to retry the `OrderQuote` at <a><b>C2</b></a> to get specific `orderedItem` level errors. Any validation errors raised at <a><b>B</b></a> regarding any property values MUST also be raised at <a><b>C2</b></a> (and ideally also <a><b>C1</b></a> if relevant), so it should be very unusual to receive an error at <a><b>B</b></a>.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: example failure response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationErrorResponse">
</pre>

For the [Booking Flow with Approval](#booking-flow-with-approval) specifically, the <a>Broker</a> decides to proceed from <a><b>A</b></a> to <a><b>B</b></a> by supplying a minimal `Order` to <a><b>B</b></a> that contains just the `orderProposalVersion` and any additional `payment` data if reauthorisation was required.

<pre class="example" title="Order Creation: example request from OrderProposal" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCreationFromProposalRequest">
</pre>


### Order Deletion

| Endpoint Name                     | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| <dfn>Order Deletion</dfn>         | REQUIRED    |      | Order            | DELETE    | `/orders/{uuid}`               |

Deleting an `Order` allows for the whole Booking Flow to be reversed for fatal error and testing scenarios.

The corresponding `Order` MUST be marked as `deleted` in the <a>Orders feed</a>, only if it is already present in the feed (which is unlikely during the [Simple Booking Flow](#simple-booking-flow)).

When an `Order` is deleted the <a>Booking System</a> SHOULD hard delete it as though it had not been created in the first place (with only a stub `deleted` record remaining, for the <a>Orders feed</a>, if necessary), but MAY soft delete it providing all related personal data is purged. The audit for the deletion is guaranteed to be stored in the <a>Broker</a> in all cases.

The <a>Booking System</a> MUST return an `OrderAlreadyExistsError` in response to <a><b>C1</b></a>, <a><b>C2</b></a>, <a><b>P</b></a> or <a><b>B</b></a> if the request includes a soft deleted or stubbed  <a>Order UUID</a>.

The <a>Broker</a> MUST NOT use Order Deletion for cancellation, but instead only use it in the unusual case of a fatal error or testing. An appropriate approach for cancellation is defined <a href="#order-cancellation">below</a>.

<pre class="example" title="Order Deletion: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderDeletionRequest">
</pre>

An Order Deletion request MUST simply return a 204 success status when an `Order` is successfully deleted.

<pre class="example" title="Order Deletion: example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderDeletionResponse">
</pre>

An Order Deletion request MUST return a 404 status when the specified `Order` is not recognised, and SHOULD return a `NotFoundError` response.

<pre class="example" title="Order Deletion: example not found response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderDeletionNotFoundResponse">
</pre>


### Order Cancellation

| Endpoint Name                     | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| <dfn>Order Cancellation</dfn>         | REQUIRED    |      | Order            | PATCH     | `/orders/{uuid}`               |

Cancellation of an `Order` may be requested by the <a>Customer</a>. `OrderItem`s omitted from the PATCH request MUST be ignored.

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example Order request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationRequest">
</pre>

The cancellation request succeeds and fails atomically.

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example success response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationSuccessResponse">
</pre>

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationErrorResponse">
</pre>

A PATCH to update `orderItemStatus` MUST have the value `https://openactive.io/CustomerCancelled`, as that is the only permissible value based on the logic defined in this version of the specification. If another value for `orderItemStatus` is specified the endpoint MUST return an `PatchNotAllowedOnProperty` error with its status code.

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example property error response" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationPatchPropertyErrorResponse">
</pre>

If the PATCH request includes any properties other than `@type`, `@context`, <a>`@id`</a>, `orderedItem` and `orderItemStatus` (excluding any properties with a custom namespace), the endpoint MUST return a `PatchContainsExcessiveProperties` error with its status code.

<pre class="example" title="Order Cancellation: example property error response for excessive properties" data-transform="dataExampleOrderCancellationExcessivePropertiesErrorResponse">
</pre>


### Orders RPDE feed

| Endpoint Name                     | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| <a>Orders feed</a>           | REQUIRED    | Yes  | Orders feed      | GET       | `/orders-rpde`                 |

This [[RPDE]] feed is described at length in the [Orders feed](#orders-feed-notifications-updates-and-refunds) section.

The <a>Orders feed</a> MUST NOT include the full contents of the <a>Opportunities</a> within the `orderedItem`, and instead MUST only include the <a>Opportunity</a> properties `@type` and <a>`@id`</a>, if `orderedItem` is included in the feed.

The `acceptedOffer` property within the <a>Orders feed</a> MUST include a snapshot of the `Offer` at the point it was booked or from the last <a>Replacement</a>, if `acceptedOffer` is included in the feed, as it reflects the <a>Customer</a>'s purchase.

An illustrative request and response is provided here.

<pre class="example" title="Order RPDE Feed: example request" data-transform="dataExampleOrderFeedRequest">

### Order Status

| Endpoint Name                     | Status      | Returns Body | Resource | HTTP Verb | Relative Path                   |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| <dfn>Order Status</dfn>               | RECOMMENDED | Yes  | Order            | GET       | `/orders/{uuid}`               |


A <a>Booking System</a> SHOULD provide an endpoint to allow a <a>Broker</a> to retrieve complete `Order`s. In future versions of the specification, endpoints may be provided which permit a <a>Broker</a> to see all `Order`s created by a <a>Customer</a>. In this current implementation, the <a>Broker</a> MUST keep its own record of `Order`s as described elsewhere in this specification, and not rely on this RECOMMENDED Order Status endpoint.

This endpoint MUST include the full contents of the <a>Opportunity</a> within the `orderedItem`, as per [Opportunity data properties](#opportunity-data-properties).

# Model

These models are designed to be compatible with [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]]. Conformance criteria for <a>Opportunity Data</a> used in the context of the Booking API are at some points stricter or more relaxed than are defined in the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification itself.

The following sections include more detail about the properties available to describe each type. Some properties are considered to be essential to ensure the provision of a minimally useful set of information for a successful booking to be made. These REQUIRED properties MUST be provided, unless otherwise specified in the associated notes.

Other properties are marked as OPTIONAL or RECOMMENDED. Implementers SHOULD provide RECOMMENDED properties if it is feasible to do so, as they will improve the quality of the user experience that is achievable for both the <a>Customer</a> and <a>Seller</a>.

Where data is not available to populate RECOMMENDED and OPTIONAL properties, publishers MUST exclude these from their requests and responses. Requests and responses MUST NOT include properties with null values, empty strings or empty arrays.

Implementers MAY include additional properties. See the section on [Handling Specification Dependencies and Extensions](#handling-specification-dependencies-and-extensions) for more information.

Applications that implement this API MUST ignore any properties that they do not understand or do not support. This allows the API to evolve as required.

Specified as a 3-letter ISO 4217 value. If a `PriceSpecification` has a zero `price`, then this property is not required. Otherwise the `priceCurrency` MUST be specified. |

### `schema:Person` for `customer` or `attendee`

For business-to-consumer transactions, the `customer` MUST be a `schema:Person`.

The required fields below relate to a `schema:Person` when used in the `customer` property. When used in the `attendee` property, required fields depend entirely on the `attendeeDetailsRequired` property.

| Property                                                           | Broker Request | Booking System Response | Type | Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|-|------|
| `@type`                                                            | REQUIRED    | - | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | `Person` |
| [`schema:identifier`](https://schema.org/identifier)                | OPTIONAL    | - | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | The identifier of the <a>Customer</a> or `attendee` used by the <a>Broker</a> and/or <a>Payment Provider</a>. |
| [`schema:email`](https://schema.org/email)                          | REQUIRED    | - | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | Email address used to uniquely identify the <a>Customer</a> or `attendee`. |
| [`schema:givenName`](https://schema.org/givenName)                  | RECOMMENDED | - | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | Name of the <a>Customer</a> or `attendee`. |
| [`schema:familyName`](https://schema.org/familyName)                | RECOMMENDED | - | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | Name of the <a>Customer</a> or `attendee`. |

Note that in all cases any `Person` received from the <a>Booking System</a> when it is reflected back in the response MUST only contain exactly the data that was provided by the <a>Broker</a> and MUST NOT contain any additional data that may be known about the `Person` by the <a>Booking System</a>. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the personal data received by the <a>Booking System</a> be treated as a "guest checkout" and is not used to create a <a>Customer</a> record in the <a>Booking System</a>.

In this current iteration of the Booking API specification, the programmatic matching of `Person` records provided by the <a>Broker</a> to existing records within the <a>Booking System</a> is considered to be out of scope, and is NOT RECOMMENDED. 

The `identifier` property MAY be provided by the <a>Broker</a> if a unique identifier for the <a>Customer</a> or `attendee` is available, to allow the <a>Booking System</a> to provide analytics based on repeat visits of the same guest. However such an `identifier` MUST only be matched within each unique set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a> to prevent identifier collisions across <a>Booking Partners</a>.

For conformance with this specification the <a>Booking System</a> MUST NOT require more data about the <a>Customer</a> than is specified as REQUIRED properties above.



### `schema:Organization` for `customer`

For business-to-business transactions, the `customer` MUST be a `schema:Organization` with the following properties.

| Property                                                           | Status      | Type | Notes |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-|------|
| `@type`                                                            | REQUIRED    | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | `OpenBookingError` |
| [`schema:name`](https://schema.org/name)                           | RECOMMENDED | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | A short, human-readable summary of the problem type, that MUST communicate the associated "Use Case" defined in this section of the specification. It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the problem, except for purposes of localization. |
| [`schema:description`](https://schema.org/description)             | RECOMMENDED | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | A human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem, providing specific information about why the error occurred in this particular case. |
| [`oa:instance`](https://openactive.io/instance)                    | RECOMMENDED | [`schema:URL`](https://schema.org/URL) | A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem. It may or may not yield further information if dereferenced. |
| [`oa:statusCode`](https://openactive.io/statusCode)                | OPTIONAL    | [`schema:Integer`](https://schema.org/Integer) | An integer representing the HTTP status code, that MUST match the associated "Status Code" defined in this section of the specification. |
| [`oa:requestId`](https://openactive.io/requestId)                  | OPTIONAL    | [`schema:Text`](https://schema.org/Text) | Used by technical support for diagnostics purposes. |



### `oa:OpenBookingError` subclasses

A number of `OpenBookingError` subclasses are specified to identify the problem type.


#### Order Creation - `OrderQuote`, `OrderProposal` and `Order` error responses

| Error Type (`@type`)                        | Status Code (`oa:statusCode`) | Use Case (`schema:name`)                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IncompleteCustomerDetailsError`            | 400         | The `email` address of the <a>Customer</a> is not supplied within a `Person` object; or the `customer` property supplied is not a valid `Person` or `Organization` object. |
| `IncompleteBrokerDetailsError`              | 400         | The `name` property is not supplied within the `Organisation` object describing the <a>Broker</a>; or the `broker` property supplied is not a valid `Organisation` object. |
| `UnnecessaryPaymentDetailsError`            | 400         | The `payment` property of the `Order` is provided when it is expected to be absent. |
| `MissingPaymentDetailsError`                | 400         | The `payment` property of the `Order` is absent when it is expected to be provided. |
| `IncompletePaymentDetailsError`             | 400         | The `payment` property of the `Order` does not include `identifier`. |
| `InvalidPaymentDetailsError`                | 400         | The `payment` property of the `OrderQuote` or `Order` contains data that is not accepted by the <a>Booking System</a> for reconciliation, e.g. an invalid `accountId`. |
| `TotalPaymentDueMismatchError`              | 400         | The `totalPaymentDue` property of the submitted `Order` or `OrderProposal` does not match the value calculated for that `Order` or `OrderProposal` by the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError`   | 409         | There are not enough available spaces in any <a>Opportunity</a> that was included the `Order`. |
| `UnableToProcessOrderItemError`             | 409         | `OrderItem` errors would have been generated at <a><b>C2</b></a> given the same set of `OrderItem`s. The <a>Broker</a> is expected to retry <a><b>C2</b></a> to retrieve such errors. <br> This error MUST only be used as a response from <a><b>P</b></a> or <a><b>B</b></a>. |
| `OrderAlreadyExistsError`                   | 500         | The <a>Order UUID</a> used for an `OrderQuote` already represents a completed `Order` with a different set of `OrderItem`s to those specified (note call to <a><b>B</b></a> is idempotent for the case where `OrderItem`s match). This happens in the rare event of a <a>Order UUID</a> clash. |
| `OrderProposalVersionOutdatedError`         | 500         | <a><b>B</b></a> failed due to a newer version of the `OrderProposal` existing than that specified by the <a>Broker</a> in `orderProposalVersion`. |
| `OrderCreationFailedError`                  | 500         | <a><b>B</b></a> failed for a reason not specified by a defined type of error in the Open Booking API specification. |
| `UnexpectedOrderTypeError`                  | 500         | The `@type` of the JSON-LD object submitted to the endpoint did not match the expected `@type`, as defined in the Open Booking API specification. |
| `SellerNotFoundError`                       | 500         | The `@id` of the `seller` included in the request was not found within the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `SellerMismatchError`                       | 500         | At least one of the `OrderItem`s did not match the specified `seller`. |


#### Order Cancellation - `OrderQuote`, `OrderProposal` and `Order` error responses

| Error Type (`@type`)                        | Status Code (`oa:statusCode`) | Use Case (`schema:name`)                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CancellationNotPermittedError`             | 400         | Cancellation is not permitted due to internal rules of the <a>Booking System</a> not otherwise exposed to the <a>Broker</a>. <br> The `description` property of the object MUST include a <a>Customer</a>-facing description of the reason that cancellation is not permitted. |
| `OrderItemNotWithinOrderError`              | 500         | The <a>Order UUID</a> for at least one provided `OrderItem` does not match the <a>Order UUID</a> of the `Order` being PATCHed. |
| `OrderItemIdInvalidError`                   | 500         | The `@id` of at least one of the provided `OrderItem`s is invalid. |



#### Order Creation - `OrderItem` errors

Note that all `OrderItem` errors for an `OrderQuote` request result in a `409 Conflict` response, as the error is expected to be resolved, and the request resubmitted, as per [[RFC2616]] section 10.4.10.

| Error Type (`@type`)                        | Status Code (`oa:statusCode`) | Use Case (`schema:name`)                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IncompleteAttendeeDetailsError`            | 409         | The `attendeeDetailsRequired` properties of the `attendee` are not supplied within a `Person` object. |
| `IncompleteOrderItemError`                  | 409         | There is a missing `acceptedOffer` or `orderedItem` property on the `OrderItem`. |
| `IncompleteIntakeFormError`                 | 409         | The `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` is missing fields that are specified as `valueRequired` within the `orderItemIntakeForm`. |
| `InvalidIntakeFormError`                    | 409         | The `orderItemIntakeFormResponse` contains invalid fields that do not match those specified by the `orderItemIntakeForm`. |
| `UnacceptableOfferError`                    | 409         | The `@id` provided for the `acceptedOffer` is not a URL which corresponds to an applicable `Offer` for the <a>Opportunity</a>. |
| `UnknownOfferError`                         | 409         | The `@id` provided for the `acceptedOffer` is not a URL which corresponds to an `Offer` within the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `UnknownOpportunityError`                   | 409         | The `@id` provided for the `orderedItem` is not a URL which corresponds to an <a>Opportunity</a> within the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `InvalidOpportunityOrOfferIdError`          | 409         | The `@id` provided for the `orderedItem` or `acceptedOffer` does not match a recognised URL format within the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `OpportunityOfferPairNotBookableError`      | 409         | The `orderedItem` and `acceptedOffer` combination specified are not "<a>bookable</a>", as defined in the Open Booking API specification. |
| `OpportunityIntractableError`               | 409         | The `orderedItem` and `acceptedOffer` combination specified currently cannot be booked due to an inconsistent state within the <a>Booking System</a>. |
| `OpportunityIsInConflictError`              | 409         | The specific `OrderItem`s against which this error is emitted are not able to be booked together. |
| `OpportunityIsFullError`                    | 409         | There are no available spaces for the <a>Opportunity</a> contained in the `orderedItem` property. |
| `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError`   | 409         | There are not enough available spaces in the <a>Opportunity</a> contained in the `orderedItem` property of the `OrderItem` to fulfil the number of repeated `OrderItem`s. <br> If the `OrderItem` is repeated (for multiple attendees) this error MUST only be included in the API response against the `OrderItem`s which are in excess of the capacity - for example in an <a>Opportunity</a> with a `remainingAttendeeCapacity` of 2 and with 5 `OrderItem`s related to it, this error would only be emitted against 3 of the `OrderItem`s. |
| `OpportunityCapacityIsReservedByLeaseError` | 409         | The available capacity required to book a specific <a>Opportunity</a> is reserved by a lease held by another <a>Customer</a>. <br> If the `OrderItem` is repeated (for multiple attendees) this error MUST only be included in the API response against the `OrderItem`s which are in excess of the capacity but which are reserved by the lease of another <a>Customer</a> - for example in an <a>Opportunity</a> with a `remainingAttendeeCapacity` of 3, with 1 additional space held by another lease, then for an `OrderQuote` with 9 `OrderItem`s related to it, this error would only be emitted against 1 of the `OrderItem`s, with `OpportunityHasInsufficientCapacityError` emitted against the other 5 of the `OrderItem`s. This helps a <a>Customer</a> to know whether they should try again. |


#### API authentication

| Error Type (`@type`)                        | Status Code (`oa:statusCode`) | Use Case (`schema:name`)                                                                                                                                                     |

# Common Requirements

This section defines some common functionality that applies to the design of the
whole API.

## Versioning Policy

The broad goal is to ensure that future versions of this specification remain backwards compatible. This will ensure that existing implementations remain valid.

New types of resource, relationships and properties can easily be added to extend the model without impacting existing functionality or interfaces. Potential breaking changes would include changing the definitions of existing properties, removing them from the specification, or changing the definition of existing interfaces.

To avoid this, the goal will be to:

- Evolve the definitions of existing properties to broadly retain their current meaning and legal values, and to ensure that changes remain compatible with existing interfaces.
- Deprecate, rather than remove properties or functionality that are judged, based on implementation experience, to be less useful or confusing. Deprecated properties will be clearly marked in both the human and machine-readable versions of the OpenActive namespace.
- Use version numbering to indicate potential for breaking changes. Minor versions, e.g. 1.1, 2.1, etc should be backwards compatible. Major versions, e.g. 2.0, 3.0 are likely to include breaking changes.
- Additional features within minor version specification releases that are required to complete a booking for a particular opportunity should make use of the `openBookingFlowRequirement` property in the open data feeds to allow <a>Brokers</a> to ignore such opportunities if they do not support the requisite feature.
- Proposed changes to the specification will also be communicated in advance of their formal release, through the sharing of public Editor's Drafts. This will provide opportunities for implementers to update their applications.


### Media types

Custom media types are used in this API to allow clients to choose the format
of the data they receive, and for <a>Booking Systems</a> to stipulate which versions
of the specification they support.

<a>Booking Systems</a> MAY choose to support additional media types but MUST support the
media type(s) defined by this specification.

Media types used in the `Accept` header of requests and `Content-Type` header of responses will conform to the following pattern, which includes only the major version of the specification:

```
application/vnd.openactive.booking+json; version=x
```

The current media type is:

```
application/vnd.openactive.booking+json; version=1
```

 <a>Brokers</a> will receive data in the most current format within that major version (e.g. 1.1, 1.2 etc).



## Handling Specification Dependencies and Extensions

### Realtime Paged Data Exchange 1.0

The <a>Orders feed</a> defined in this specification is an [[RPDE]] feed which conforms exactly to [[RPDE]] 1.0, except for [section 5.1.3](https://www.openactive.io/realtime-paged-data-exchange/#content-type) where instead it uses media type `application/vnd.openactive.booking+json; version=1`.

Although additional <a>Orders feed</a> conforming to later versions of the [[RPDE]] specification and even to later versions of this specification MAY be implemented in parallel, implementations that are compliant with this version of the specification MUST utilise an <a>Orders feed</a> that conforms to [[RPDE]] 1.0.

### Modelling Opportunity Data 2.x (where x >= 0)

The model defined in this specification builds on the model defined in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] 2.0. Concepts from the model fall into three categories:
- The <a>Opportunity</a>, and all types used within it, are defined entirely in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] and not within this specification. This is covered in below in [Opportunity data extensions](#opportunity-data-extensions).
- The `Offer` which is defined across both [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] and within this specification. If any conflict exists in the definition of properties and values between this specification and a future version of [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]], the definition in this specification MUST take precedent.
- For all other types defined in both specifications, the conformance criteria in this specification MUST take precedent, and any conformance criteria in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] related to such types MUST be ignored.

#### Opportunity data extensions

Within the scope of the <a>Opportunity</a> (`orderedItem`) and `Offer` (`acceptedOffer`), the <a>Booking System</a> MAY include additional properties, where such properties are either:
- Specified in future minor versions of the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] 2.x (where x > 0).
- Defined in custom vocabularies as described in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] 2.0 Section 5.13.3, including the [[OpenActive-Beta-Namespace]].

Within the scope of the <a>Opportunity</a> (`orderedItem`), the <a>Booking System</a> MAY include additional properties, where such properties are:
- Defined in Schema.org as described in [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] 2.0 Section 5.13.2.

To ensure backward compatibility, within the scope of the <a>Opportunity</a> (`orderedItem`) and `Offer` (`acceptedOffer`), the <a>Booking System</a> MUST:
- Conform to the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] 2.0 specification by providing REQUIRED fields, unless otherwise stated in this specification.
- Provide any data that is vital for the <a>Customer</a> to make an informed decision about the product they are purchasing (such as important restrictions on purchase), using properties specified within this specification and [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] 2.0, and hence not rely on additional properties.

A <a>Broker</a> MUST ensure that any values of properties found in the <a>Opportunity</a> (`orderedItem`) and `Offer` (`acceptedOffer`), that are defined within this specification and [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] 2.0, and that are vital for the <a>Customer</a> to make an informed decision about the product they are purchasing, are communicated to the <a>Customer</a>. A <a>Broker</a> MAY, at its discretion, also choose to communicate the value of additional properties.

#### Booking functionality extensions

Any extension to the functionality of this specification MUST NOT be inferred from additional properties included in future minor versions of the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification. Given the scope of the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification, such additional properties will serve simply to provide greater expressivity to the <a>Opportunities</a> and `Offer`s the <a>Customer</a> is selecting. Functional extensions to the booking process itself fall properly within the scope of Open Booking API specification, and hence should be integrated with future versions of this specification.

The [[OpenActive-Beta-Namespace]] and properties in custom namespaces (as described in the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification) MAY be used to extend and experiment with new functionality for future inclusion in _this_ specification. However all functionality MUST work as described in this specification should these extensions be completely ignored by either the <a>Broker</a>, the <a>Booking System</a> or both. 


### General extension mechanism

Additional OPTIONAL extension terms (including properties, classes and enumerations) MAY be included in any request and response defined within this specification using a custom namespace (as specified in the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] specification), and the presence and values of such extension terms MAY alter the behaviour of the API.

An API implementing this specification MAY also choose to define additional extension endpoints, which MUST accept and require a different media type to that defined in this specification.

To ensure full compatibility with this specification, use of such extension terms and extension endpoints MUST NOT be required as part of the operations defined in this specification, and the API MUST function in complete conformity with this specification when such extension terms and extension endpoints are omitted or ignored.

Any extension terms and extension endpoints defined for an API implementation MUST be fully documented, in order to ensure that the <a>Seller</a> has a complete view of the functionality it is exposing to the <a>Broker</a>.

#### Extension example: Member booking

The example below demonstrates hypothetical extension terms defined in <a><b>B</b></a> to allow for existing registered members to book without supplying customer details or payment details, using the custom `"acme"` namespace and associated context.

<pre class="example" title="Extension Example: Member booking" data-transform="dataExampleExtensionMemberBookingRequest">
</pre>

#### Extension example: Additional information during the ordering process

The example below demonstrates hypothetical extension terms defined in <a><b>B</b></a> that adds additional OPTIONAL properties to help track a bespoke agreement, using the custom `"acme"` namespace and associated context.

<pre class="example" title="Extension Example: Bespoke agreement data" data-transform="dataExampleExtensionBespokeAgreementDetailsRequest">
</pre>

#### Extension example: Integrated Payments

In some limited circumstances it might also be desirable for an Open Booking API to act as a facade over a <a>Booking System</a>, <a>Payment Provider</a>, and Invoicing systems. For these circumstances the `Payment` type may be subclassed to facilitate full payment, using a custom namespace and associated context.

<pre class="example" title="Extension Example: Integrated Payments">
  "payment": {
    "@type": "acme:IntegratedPayment",
    "identifier": "12345678ABCD",
    "paymentMethod": "acme:StripePayment",
    "acme:token": "tok_KPte7942xySKBKyrBu11yEpf"
  },
</pre>

Note that due to the variety of business models available in the OpenActive ecosystem, conformance to this specification requires that the use of any native payment functionality in the <a>Booking System</a> be OPTIONAL.

#### Extension example: Waiting list endpoint

The example below demonstrates a hypothetical extension endpoint to support waiting list registration.

<pre class="example" title="Extension Example: Waiting List Endpoint" data-transform="dataExampleExtensionWaitingListRequest">
</pre>


## Response formats

Requests and response documents exchanged via this API will all be valid
[[!JSON-LD]] documents, with the exception of the <a>Orders feed</a>, where only documents
included in the `data` property are valid [[!JSON-LD]].

The [[!JSON-LD]] documents MUST include a [[!JSON-LD]] `context` that refers
to the [[!OpenActive-Vocabulary]] as follows:

<pre class="example" title="minimal JSON-LD document">
{
  "@context": "https://openactive.io/"
}
</pre>

Unless otherwise specified the request and response documents MUST conform to
the [[Modelling-Opportunity-Data]] data model.

### Globally unique identifiers

<dfn>`@id`</dfn> properties are used as identifiers throughout this specification, for compatibility with [[!JSON-LD]]. The value of such a property MUST always be an absolute URI that provides a stable globally unique identifier for the resource, as described in [[RFC3986]].

The primary purpose of the URI format in this context is to provide natural namespacing for the identifier. Hence, the URI itself MAY not resolve to a valid endpoint (unless otherwise specified), but MUST use a domain name controlled by the resource owner. In all cases where <a>`@id`</a> is referenced in this specification, the resource owner is the <a>Booking System</a>.


## Errors

Error responses MUST be served using an appropriate HTTP 4XX status code or HTTP 5XX status code specified in the model.

All error responses from this API MUST be returned in a JSON-LD format subclass of the `OpenBookingError` using a content type of `application/vnd.openactive.booking+json; version=1`.

<pre class="example" title="Error response example" data-transform="dataExampleErrorResponse">
</pre>


## Rate Limiting

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY choose to apply rate limiting for each unique set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a>. In such circumstances where a request is rate limited, the <a>Booking System</a> MUST return a response with status code 429.

To allow for a broad range of API management solutions to be used, the <a>Broker</a> MUST rely only on the status code 429 when detecting and retrying a rate-limited request, as specified elsewhere in this specification. The following guidance is included to encourage convergence in implementations where possible. 

All rate-limited responses from this API SHOULD return a JSON-LD format `TooManyRequestsError` object using a content type of `application/vnd.openactive.booking+json; version=1` with status code 429.

The response SHOULD also include the `Retry-After` HTTP Header with a value set to the number of seconds after which the <a>Broker</a> SHOULD retry as per [[RFC2616]] section 14.37. 

<pre class="example" title="Rate limited response example" data-transform="dataExampleRateLimitResponse">
</pre>


## Security

Although this specification does not mandate a specific means of securing an API, it does mandate that at a minimum all HTTP requests and responses MUST be secured using SSL.


## Authentication

All of the API transactions described in this document MUST require authentication.

<dfn>Authentication Credentials</dfn> to facilitate access to the Open Booking API on behalf of multiple <a>Brokers</a> are uniquely and securely provisioned to the authenticating party by the <a>Booking System</a>.

The term <dfn>Booking Partner</dfn> is used to refer to the authenticating party represented by the <a>Authentication Credentials</a>, which is distinct from the <a>Broker</a> represented by the `broker` property. The <a>Booking Partner</a> may be a <a>Broker</a>, or a <a>Middleware</a>, or any other authenticating party (including the <a>Seller</a> if `brokerRole` is set to `NoBroker`).

<a>Authentication Credentials</a> also grant granular authorisation for the specific <a>Booking Partner</a> to access all [endpoints](#endpoints) on behalf of explicitly consenting <a>Sellers</a>; with the exception of the <a>Orders feed</a>, which does not require granular authorisation. Access to a single <a>Orders feed</a> containing data items relating to all authorised <a>Sellers</a> of the <a>Booking Partner</a> MUST be available via their <a>Authentication Credentials</a>, and such data items MUST be marked as [[RPDE]] `"state": "deleted"` when such authorisation is revoked.

<a>Authentication Credentials</a> MUST be capable of being reprovisioned (e.g. a new [[OAuth2]] Client Secret generated) without losing any association to their related `Order` data.


### API level authentication and data security

The content and data available to all endpoints provided by the <a>Booking System</a> MUST be specific to the <a>Authentication Credentials</a> in order to ensure that bookings are secure. It is the responsibility of the <a>Booking System</a> to ensure that only the <a>Authentication Credentials</a> responsible for creating an `Order` (including any of its subclasses) can subsequently access, amend, or cancel that `Order`; and only do so if the associated <a>Seller</a>'s authorisation for that <a>Booking Partner</a> is still active.

For security, <a>Order UUID</a>s MUST only be considered unique within a given set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a>. It MUST be possible for two different `Order`s that are created via two different <a>Authentication Credentials</a> to exist with the same <a>Order UUID</a>.

This specification does not mandate a particular authentication method, but its recommendation is that implementers should consider using [[OAuth2]] as it is well-defined, widely supported and can be used in a variety of different application flows (e.g. via a JavaScript web application or between servers). For <a>Booking Systems</a> that support multiple <a>Sellers</a>, OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) is recommended in addition to this for the <a>Booking Partner</a> to access a particular <a>Seller</a>.

Other server-to-server authentication mechanisms such as basic authentication, API key or bearer token-based mechanisms are also appropriate.

### Middleware as a catalyst

This specification permits trusted <dfn>Middleware</dfn> to use a single set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a> to interact with the <a>Booking System</a> for their authorised <a>Sellers</a> on behalf of multiple <a>Brokers</a>. This lowers the barrier to entry for the creation of new <a>Brokers</a> that might otherwise need to establish <a>Authentication Credentials</a> and/or relationships with a large number of <a>Sellers</a>.

<figure>
 <img src="authentication-credentials.png" alt="Authentication Credentials and Middleware">
 <figcaption>Authentication Credentials may facilitate access to the Booking System directly (Broker) or indirectly (Middleware), for a specific Seller</figcaption>
</figure>

The definition of the <a>Middleware</a> role in this specification is intentionally broad: it is simply any party that handles <a>Authentication Credentials</a> and lies between one or many public-facing <a>Brokers</a> and the <a>Seller</a>. 'Middleware' thus includes not only dedicated middleware technology companies, but also parent organisations or agencies that manage a number of brands, affiliate platforms, etc.

This specification thus keeps <a>Authentication Credentials</a> separate from the concept of a <a>Broker</a> within the <a>Booking System</a>. While all <a>Brokers</a> must be associated with a set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a>, note that this is a one-to-many relationship: one set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a> MUST be able be used on behalf of many <a>Brokers</a>. The introduction of a new <a>Broker</a> (as specified by the `broker` property) MUST be possible by simply including the details within the requests of this API, with no additional out-of-band registration required.

<figure>
 <img src="authentication-credentials-data-isolation.png" alt="Data Isolation within Authentication Credentials">
 <figcaption>Data is isolated between Authentication Credentials, with one set of Authentication Credentials allowing access to many Brokers</figcaption>
</figure>

In terms of implementation, all data partitioning and security MUST be based on the <a>Authentication Credentials</a>; the `broker` property within the `Order` is for information only.

A client using the same <a>Authentication Credentials</a> MUST be able to represent more than one <a>Broker</a>, and the <a>Booking System</a> MUST make no assumptions regarding which <a>Broker</a> is being represented by a particular set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a>. For the avoidance of doubt: the same <a>Broker</a> accessing a <a>Booking System</a> using two sets of <a>Authentication Credentials</a> MUST NOT be able to access `Order`s created by one set of <a>Authentication Credentials</a> when using the other, and is considered as two separate identically-named <a>Brokers</a> by the <a>Booking System</a>.

Note that the `broker` property in the request body is to help the <a>Booking System</a> to clarify which <a>Broker</a> is making the request and to help them in situations such as <a>Customer</a> queries. It is not designed as any part of an authentication which MUST be performed outside of the JSON body of the request. Authentication tokens MUST NOT be present within the `broker` property of the submitted JSON.

The `broker` property MUST contain the details of the actual <a>Broker</a> rather than any <a>Middleware</a>.

Where information regarding the <a>Middleware</a> or any other <a>Booking Partner</a> is required for audit, this SHOULD be captured by the <a>Booking System</a> at the point of provision of <a>Authentication Credentials</a>.

The <a>Booking System</a> MAY choose to produce usage reports against <a>Booking Partners</a> via their unique <a>Authentication Credentials</a>, as well as against <a>Brokers</a> identified by the `broker` property, to report at different levels of granularity. However <a>Booking Systems</a> MUST NOT produce reconciliation reports based on anything other than the information provided to the `Payment` object, i.e. there MUST be no assumed link between the <a>Authentication Credentials</a> used for access, the <a>Broker</a> (`broker`) data provided for information to the API, and the `Payment` data detailing the account into which the money is deposited for reconciliation. It MUST be possible for the same `Payment` details to be used across multiple <a>Authentication Credentials</a> and <a>Brokers</a>.

Any <a>Middleware</a> that conforms with this specification MUST provide data partitioning and security with respect to <a>Broker</a> access, to ensure that <a>Brokers</a> only have access to their own data.

### Customer level authentication

OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) is recommended as standard way of verifying the identity of the <a>Customer</a>.

One principle relating to authentication and the Booking API is that `Order`s created by a specific <a>Customer</a> MUST NOT be able to be changed by any other <a>Customer</a>. It is the responsibility of the <a>Broker</a> to ensure that subsequent requests to an `Order` should only be initiated by the <a>Customer</a> which created the `Order`.

### OpenID Connect Booking Partner Authentication for Multiple Seller Systems

For <a>Booking Systems</a> that support multiple <a>Sellers</a>, OpenID Connect ([[OpenIdConnect]]) is recommended when providing the <a>Booking Partner</a> access to a particular <a>Seller</a>.

In order to support convergence amongst implementations, a number of recommendations are included below, which include recommended terms for names of <a>Scopes</a> and <a>Claims</a>.

This section requires a basic understanding of OpenID Connect.

#### OAuth Flows and Scopes

The objective of an OAuth flow is for the <a>Booking Partner</a> to acquire an <dfn>Access Token</dfn>, which is an <a>Authentication Credential</a> that provides access to a subset the Open Booking API [endpoints](#endpoints) of the <a>Booking System</a> for a particular <a>Seller</a>, or to the <a>Orders feed</a> for all authorised <a>Sellers</a>.

The <a>Booking Partner</a> SHOULD include the relevant <a>Access Token</a> in the `Authorization` header when accessing the Open Booking API endpoints.

An expiry duration of 15 minutes is RECOMMENDED for <a>Access Token</a>, to ensure the <a>Seller</a> has sufficient control.

The recommended flows are as following:

- <a>Authorization Code Flow</a> for <a>Sellers</a> to approve <a>Booking Partners</a> to interact with bookings on their behalf.

- <a>Client Credentials Flow</a> to provide access to a single <a>Orders feed</a> for all authorised <a>Sellers</a>.

An OAuth <dfn>Scope</dfn> defines access to a set of endpoints, and also expectations about <a>Claims</a> returned. An <a>Access Token</a> can be requested that includes a number of scopes, via the relevant OAuth flow.

The RECOMMENDED <a>Scopes</a> and flows are defined in the table below:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Scope</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Endpoints</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">OAuth flow used to acquire Access Token</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><code>openactive-openbooking</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>OrderQuote Creation (C1)</p>
        <p>OrderQuote Creation (C2)</p>
        <p>OrderQuote Deletion</p>
        <p>Order Creation (B)</p>
        <p>Order Deletion</p>
        <p>Order Cancellation</p>
        <p>Order Status</p>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left"><a>Authorization Code Flow</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><code>openactive-ordersfeed</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Orders RPDE Feed</td>
      <td style="text-align:left"><a>Client Credentials Flow</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In order to implement functionality to suspend bookings temporarily with a particular <a>Seller</a>, the <a>Booking System</a> SHOULD temporarily revoke access to the `openactive-openbooking` scope. The <a>Seller</a>'s items SHOULD still be available in the <a>Orders Feed</a>, and hence <a>Customers</a> are still able to receive refunds and notifications, but cannot make new bookings or initiate cancellations.


##### Authorization Code Flow

To access any of the [endpoints](#endpoints) defined in this specification other than the [Orders RPDE Feed](#orders-rpde-feed), the <a>Booking Partner</a> SHOULD first acquire a valid <a>Access Token</a> with an `openactive-openbooking` <a>Scope</a>, by having a particular <a>Seller</a> complete the <dfn>Authorization Code Flow</dfn>.

This flow presents the <a>Seller</a> with an authentication and consent prompt, that they will be familiar from websites that offer "Login with my social media account" functionality:

<figure>
 <img src="seller-authentication.png" alt="Seller Authentication Page">
 <figcaption>Example authorization page for a Booking Partner, presented by a Booking System.</figcaption>
</figure>

A <dfn>Refresh Token</dfn> SHOULD also be also provided during this flow, which allows the <a>Booking Partner</a> to request another <a>Access Token</a> once it has expired, without the <a>Seller</a> needing to reauthenticate.

Additionally, a "one-time usage" <dfn>ID Token</dfn> SHOULD be provided during this flow which contains the `SellerId` and other details of the <a>Seller</a>. This allows the <a>Booking Partner</a> to store the <a>Access Token</a> and <a>Refresh Token</a> against the correct `SellerId` in their database, so they can use these when booking the <a>Seller</a>'s opportunities.

The Authorization Request of this flow SHOULD include the `openactive-openbooking`, `openid`, and `offline_access` <a>Scopes</a>, to ensure that an <a>Access Token</a>, <a>ID Token</a> and <a>Refresh Token</a> are all returned for the authenticating <a>Seller</a>.

For this flow, it is RECOMMENDED that the OpenID Connect subject is not the end user who is following the OAuth flow, but is instead the <a>Seller</a> that they represent - such that if, for example, the end user no longer works for the <a>Seller</a> and deletes their account, their authentication grants remain unaffected. This recommendation conforms with OpenID Connect from a technical perspective, which is useful when utilising existing libraries.

<figure>
 <img src="authorization-code-flow.png" alt="Authorization Code Flow">
 <figcaption>Authorization Code Flow</figcaption>
</figure>


##### Client Credentials Flow

The straightforward <dfn>Client Credentials Flow</dfn> SHOULD be used to retrieve an <a>Access Token</a> with an `openactive-ordersfeed` <a>Scope</a>, which grants access to the <a>Orders Feed</a> endpoint as above.

The Authorization Request of the flow SHOULD include only the `openactive-ordersfeed` <a>Scope</a>.

<figure>
 <img src="client-credentials-flow.png" alt="Client Credentials Flow">
 <figcaption>Client Credentials Flow</figcaption>
</figure>


#### Custom Claims

<dfn>Claims</dfn> are simply key-value pairs that are included in <a>Access Tokens</a> and <a>ID Tokens</a>; each <a>Claim</a> is "claiming" a fact about the subject (in this case, the <a>Seller</a>). For example a token may include a "claim" that the <a>Seller</a> has a name of "Acme Leisure".

The OpenActive namespace includes a number of terms for use as Custom Claims.

##### ID Token claims

The <a>ID Token</a> is designed to be read by the <a>Booking Partner</a> to give them information about the <a>Seller</a> that has just authenticated.  This allows the <a>Booking Partner</a> to store the <a>Access Token</a> and <a>Refresh Token</a> against the correct `SellerId` in their database, so they can use these when booking the <a>Seller</a>'s opportunities.

It is RECOMMENDED that the `openactive-openbooking` <a>Scope</a> includes an implicit request that <a>Claims</a> listed below are included in the <a>ID Token</a>.

The following custom claims are for use by the <a>Booking Partner</a>, and must conform to the custom claim names specified below. The custom claim names are collision-resistant in accordance with [the OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#rfc.section.5.1.2). 

| Custom claim | Description | Exactly matches |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `https://openactive.io/sellerName` | The seller name. | `name` of  `seller` |
| `https://openactive.io/sellerLogo` | A URL of the logo of the Seller. | `logo` of  `seller` |
| `https://openactive.io/sellerUrl` | The URL of the website of the Seller. | `url` of  `seller` |
| `https://openactive.io/sellerId` | The Seller ID as a JSON-LD ID. Also allows for compatibility with existing authentication implementations which might be using "sub" to include a different identifier. Booking partners will use this to determine which Seller ID the provided accessToken is intended for.  | `id` of  `seller` |
| `https://openactive.io/bookingServiceName` | The `name` of the Booking System | `name` of  `bookingService` |
| `https://openactive.io/bookingServiceUrl` | The `url` of the website of the Booking System | `url` of  `bookingService` |

##### Access Token claims

To help simplify the implementation, it is recommended that <a>Access Tokens</a> include the following custom claims.

The <a>Access Token</a> is only read internally by the <a>Booking System</a>, and so these claims are simply a recommendation. Hence the claim names do not need to be standardised as long as they are internally consistent.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">Custom claim</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Description</th>
      <th style="text-align:left">Scopes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><code>https://openactive.io/clientId</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">The <a>Booking Partner</a> Client ID that requested
        the <a>Access Token</a>. Note that this claim is due to be featured in a <a
        href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-token-exchange-19#section-4.3">future OAuth 2.0 specification</a>, and it is RECOMMENDED that the newly specified claim is used in preference to this one, once ratified.</td>
      <td
      style="text-align:left">
        <p><code>openactive-openbooking</code> and <code>openactive-ordersfeed</code>
        </p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left"><code>https://openactive.io/sellerId</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Seller ID as a JSON-LD ID, which is useful to be provided
        to Open Booking API endpoints to determine which <a>Seller</a> the <a>Access Token</a> is intended
        for. It is consistent with the claim name used in the <a>ID Token</a>.</td>
      <td
      style="text-align:left"><code>openactive-openbooking</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
